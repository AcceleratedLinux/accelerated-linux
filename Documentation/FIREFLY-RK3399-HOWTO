Firefly RK-3399
---------------

The Firefly RK-3399 board is based around the Marvel Rockchip 3399 SoC.
It is a 6-core ARM64 based device, with 2 fast A72 CPU cores and four slower
A53 CPU cores. It has 4GB of RAM, serial port, ethernet port, SD-card and
a few other peripherals fitted. It is a 

Generate images for this board using the Firefly/RK-3399 uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select glibc when building. The build will
generate 3 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/Image,
images/urootfs.bin and the devicetree blob rk3399-firefly.dtb.

The produce to load and run the binaries is a bit klunky at the moment.
You will need to use an SD-CARD and copy the files into it using dd.
You need to copy a working SD-CARD based ubuntu system onto the SD-CARD.
With that in place then you can copy your built image with:

    dd if=images/rk3399-firefly.dtb of=/dev/sdi seek=32768
    dd if=images/Image of=/dev/sdi seek=34816
    dd if=images/rootfs.bin of=/dev/sdi seek=262144

Once the SD-CARD is loaded into the RK-3399 then you can use the following
u-boot commands to load and run:

    setenv bootargs console=ttyS2,1500000 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x20000000,16M
    mmc dev 1
    mmc read 0x10000000 0x8000 0x800
    mmc read 0x11000000 0x8800 0x10000
    mmc read 0x20000000 0x40000 0x10000
    booti 0x11000000 - 0x10000000

The console will be the serial port attached via the micro USB port and
converter dongle. The default is the unusual speed of 1500000 baud.
