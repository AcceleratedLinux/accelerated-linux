NetBurner MOD5272 How To
------------------------

This is some tips about how to archive uClinux running in NetBurner MOD5272,
but it is applied to MOD5282 too.

The NetBurner TFTP client don't work correctly with Linux TFTP server, to
get it working you need manually set the target IP and MAC in your host
(where TFTP server is running) to it use the ARP command:

    arp -s 192.168.0.1 00:03:F4:01:1E:F0

Where 192.168.0.1 is the target (MOD5272) board and 00:03:F4:01:1E:F0 is
the target MAC address.

You need copy the image.s19 to your TFTP directory using uppercase characters,
because the NetBurner TFTP client convert the input file name to uppercase:

    cp images/image.s19 /tftpboot/IMAGE.S19

Start the board and enter in NetBurner monitor (press 'A' key in serial
console), then execute:

    NB> ndl image.s19

When the download finished execute:

    NB> go 2000000

Then uClinux will start.

If you want write uClinux in MOD5272 flash memory use the compcode from
NetBurner SDK, you can recompile this program to Linux since source code is
available. Execute this command:

    compcode IMAGE.S19 IMAGEAPP.S19

To write it in MOD5272 flash use this command:

    NB> nfla imageapp.s19
