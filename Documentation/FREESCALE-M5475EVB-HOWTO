Freescale M5475EVB Evaluation Board
-----------------------------------

The Freescale M5475EVB development board comes with 64MB of RAM, and has
2 internal ethernet devices. The M5475 CPU also has an MMU (Memory Management
Unit) built in - unlike most other ColdFire family members.

There are 2 targets for this board in the uClinux-dist. One generates a
system that runs without the MMU enabled (Freescale/M5475EVB), and the other
generates a system with the MMU enabled (Freescale/M5475EVB-MMU).

You can run the 2.4.x or 3.x kernel with MMU disabled, but you must use the
3.x kernel if you want a system with the MMU enabled. There is no 2.0.x
kernel support for this board. You must use the uClibc library with these
targets too.

No matter what type of system you build for the M5475EVB the build process
results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded into the M5475EVB
board using the builtin dBUG firmware.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x20000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
M5475EVB board this is the same serial port that dBUG runs on. Its is the
port labeled "PSC0" on the board. uClinux/Coldfire configures this port for
19200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot
messages come out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an
interactive Linux shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
