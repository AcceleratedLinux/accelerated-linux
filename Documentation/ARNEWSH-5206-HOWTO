Arnewsh 5206 Evaluation Board
-----------------------------

Most Arnewsh 5206 boards come equiped with 1MB of RAM as standard.
The default configuration in uClinux-dist for this board will make an
image small enough to run on this.

The standard build uses the latest linux kernel and uClibc.
(Note that glibc is *not* supported on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be
loaded into the A5206 board.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x10000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
Arnewsh 5206 board this is the other serial port, not the port normally used
for dBUG. uClinux/Coldfire will configure this port for 9600 baud, 8 data
bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot messages come
out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an interactive Linux
shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
