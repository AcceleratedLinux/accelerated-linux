Motorola M5282EVB Evaluation Board
----------------------------------

The Motorola M5282EVB board comes standard with 8MB SDRAM, builtin 10/100 Mb
ethernet controller, 512kB of internal flash, and a host of other builtin
peripherals.

The standard build uses the latest linux kernel and uClibc.
(Note that glibc is *not* supported on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded
into the M5282EVB board using the builtin dBUG firmware.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x10000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
M5282EVB board this is the same serial port that dBUG runs on. Its is the
port labeled "Terminal". uClinux/Coldfire configures this port for 19200
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot
messages come out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an
interactive Linux shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
