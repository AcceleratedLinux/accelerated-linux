Intel Minnow Board
------------------

The (Intel) Minnow Board is based around an Intel Atom E38xx SoC.
Typically it is fitted with 1 or 2 GB of RAM and a handful of assorted
peripherals.

To generate images for this board use the Intel/MinnowBoard uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select uClibc when building. The build will
generate 2 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/bzImage
and images/initrd.gz.

The simplest way to boot on the Minnow board is to use a USB flash stick.
You need a USB stick that is formated with a FAT32 filesystem. When copying
the bzImage to the flash stick rename it to bzImage.efi. Also copy the
initrd.gz file.

Insert the USB flash stick into a USB slot on the Minnow board. Boot up
using the serial console (you will need a serial debug header fitted to
the Minnow). At the console prompt do:


    fs0:
    bzImage.efi console=ttyS0,115200 initrd=initrd.gz root=/dev/ram0

That assumes you copied the image files to the root directory of the flash
stick. If not then change directories (using the "cd" command) before
running the kernel).
