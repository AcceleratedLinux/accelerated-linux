Freescale IMX6UltraLite Evaluation Kit
--------------------------------------

The Freescale IMX6UltraLite evaluation kit is based around the iMX6 SoC.
It has 512Mb of RAM, serial port, ethernet port, SD-card and a few other
peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the Freescale/IMX6UltraLite uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select the uClibc when building. The build will
generate 3 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/zImage,
images/urootfs.bin and images/imx6ul-14x14-evk.dtb.

You can load onto the IMX6UltraLite using the usual uboot loader do this
installed in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot serial
port prompt, by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    setenv bootargs console=ttymxc0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x83800000,16M
    dhcp ukernel.bin
    tftp 0x837fffc0 urootfs.bin
    tftp 0x83000000 imx6ul-14x14-evk.dtb
    bootm 0x80800000 0x837fffc0 0x83000000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses 192.168.0.0/24, and
a tftp server at 192.168.0.22. Adjust the above commands as necessary for
your different network setup.

The console is the USB debug serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1).
