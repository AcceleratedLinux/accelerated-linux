Freescale IMX28EVK Evaluation Kit
---------------------------------

The Freescale IMX28EVK development board is based around the iMX28 SoC.
It has 128Mb of RAM, serial port, ethernet port, SD-card and a few other
peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the Freescale/IMX28EVK uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select the uClibc when building. The build will
generate 3 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/ukernel.bin,
images/urootfs.bin and images/imx28-evk.dtb.

You can load onto the IMX28EVK using the usual uboot loader that is installed
in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot serial port prompt,
by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x44000000,16M
    dhcp ukernel.bin
    tftp 0x43ffffc0 urootfs.bin
    tftp 0x43000000 imx28-evk.dtb
    bootm 0x42000000 0x43ffffc0 0x43000000

This assumes you have a local network with and file server that is configured
with a DHCP server. If not you can change out the u-boot "dhcp" command with
a fixed address setup using something like this:

    setenv ipaddr 192.168.0.111
    setenv serverip 192.168.0.22
    tftp 0x42000000 ukernel.bin

The console will be the debug serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1).
