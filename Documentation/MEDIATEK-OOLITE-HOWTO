MediaTek Oolite
---------------

The MediaTek Oolite board is based around the MediaTek MT6721 SoC.
It has 512MB of RAM, serial port, ethernet ports, SD-card and a few other
peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the MediaTek/Oolite uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select uClibc when building. The build will
generate 2 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/ukernel.bin
and images/urootfs.bin.

You can load onto the Oolite using the usual uboot loader that is installed
in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot serial port prompt,
by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    #setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1
    #setenv serverip 192.168.1.22
    #tftpboot 0x81000000 uImage.bin
    #bootm 0x81000000

    setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1
    setenv serverip 192.168.1.22
    tftpboot 0x88000000 rootfs.bin
    tftpboot 0x81000000 ukernel.bin
    bootm 0x81000000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses 192.168.1.0/24, and
a tftp server at 192.168.1.22. Adjust the above commands as necessary for
your different network setup.

The console will be the serial port (at the default 57600,8,n,1).
