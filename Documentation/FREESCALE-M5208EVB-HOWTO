Freescale M5208EVB Evaluation Board
-----------------------------------

The new Freescale M5208EVB development board comes with 32MB SDRAM, and
has an internal FEC ethernet device. The default uClinux configuration
includes an ethernet driver for this device.

The standard board build uses the latest kernel (4.x currently) and uClibc.
(Note that glibc is *not* supported on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded
into the M5208EVB board using the builtin dBUG firmware.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x40020000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
M5208EVB board this is the same serial port that dBUG runs on. Its is the
port labeled "Terminal". uClinux/Coldfire configures this port for 115200
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot
messages come out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an
interactive Linux shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
