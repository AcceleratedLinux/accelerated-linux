BananaPi BPI-R2
---------------

The BananaPi BPI-R2 board is based around the MediaTek 7623 SoC.
It has 2GB of RAM, serial port, ethernet ports, SD-card and a few other
peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the BananaPi/BPI-R2 uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select uClibc when building. The build will
generate 2 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/ukernel.bin
and images/urootfs.bin.

You can load onto the BPI-R2 using the usual uboot loader. Most likely you
will need to install a normal system image (such as Ubuntu, or OpenWRT)
onto an SD-CARD to boot that on the BPI-R2. 

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    setenv ipaddr 192.168.0.111
    setenv serverip 192.168.0.22
    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x88000000,16M
    tftp 0x84000000 ukernel.bin
    tftp 0x87ffffc0 urootfs.bin
    bootm 0x84000000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses 192.168.0.0/24, and
a tftp server at 192.168.0.22. Adjust the above commands as necessary for
your different network setup.

The console will be the serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1).
