1  Introduction

This is the top level of the directory structure with documents about
our COBRAXXXX boards.

2  The boards

The senTec COBRA5272 is a board based on the Motorola ColdFire 5272.
The COBRA5282 is based on the MCF5282.
Both boards are supported in the uClinux distribution of Lineo
(http://www.uclinux.org/).

3	Structure of the documentation directory

You can find some basic documents in English under ./en. Currently we
just have a Getting-Started and a (very small) FAQ. I hope I can write
some more docu in the near future.
