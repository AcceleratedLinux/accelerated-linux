STARTING

To get started with the development of uClinux, please read the
document uClinux-dist/README. It contains everything you need to set
up your tool chain, to configure the kernel and so on.

To get a first working image you should go into the main config menu
("uClinux v3.1.0 Configuration") and select the "Target Platform
Selection". There you choose "senTec" as vendor, and your
plattform (COBRA5272 or COBRA5282).

Under "Kernel/Library/Defaults Selection" you can choose
your preferred kernel (we suggest linux-2.4.x at first),
and which libc version you want to use (uClibc should
work).

Then you leave the main menu with "Exit", and answer "Yes"
to save the new config. Finally you do "make dep;make".

You should find a file called images/image.bin if the build
process is finished. The build tool also attempts to
copy image.bin into the /tftpboot directory. If you see
an error in that step, please verify the existance and
the permissions of that directory. If it is there, you can
type "dn image.bin" in dBUG, and it will try to download that
image. If you get an error, look if the setup of your TFTP
server is correct, and that the config of IP addresses, netmask,
filename and filetype in dBUG are correct ("show" to check,
"set" to correct). If the download is successful, you can
start the image then with "go 20000" (on COBRA5272) or
"go 10000" (on COBRA5282).

HINT: You can try to mount a directory /home/uClinux
via NFS, that could be your working directory for software
development. If that doesn't work, please check that
a) the directory (or a link by the same name) exists
b) you have permissions to mount it
c) the setup for the IP is correkt. If they are not, please
   correct the settings either in romfs/etc/rc and "make romfs"
   then, or in vendors/senTec/romfs/etc/rc and do a "make" again.
   (The setup of the IPs in dBUG seem to work already, because
   you wouldn't have a chance to download the image).
