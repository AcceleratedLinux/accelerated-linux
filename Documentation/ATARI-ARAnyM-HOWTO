ATARI-ARAnyM
------------

The Atari/Atari vendor/target is setup to run on the ARAnyM (Atari
Running on ANY Machine) emulator (see http://aranym.org).

I just used the standard Ubuntu package install of aranym, which is
version 0.9.9 as of this writing. You need an appropriate config file,
and then you simply run something like:

  aranym-mmu -l -c /tmp/config


And that config file contains something like:

	[GLOBAL]
	FastRAM = 196
	AutoGrabMouse = No

	[LILO]
	Kernel = /home/gerg/uClinux-dist/images/vmlinux.gz
	Args = root=/dev/ram load_ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=4096 video=atafb:tthigh console=tty0 debug stram_swap=0
	Ramdisk = /home/gerg/uClinux-dist/images/ramdisk

	[ETH0]
	Type = bridge
	Tunnel = tap0

	[STARTUP]
	GrabMouse = No
	Debugger = No


The target is a very small and simple configuration, nothing fancy.
