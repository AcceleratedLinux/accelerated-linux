Freescale IMX50EVK Evaluation Kit
---------------------------------

The Freescale IMX50EVK development board is based around the iMX508 SoC.
It has 512Mb of RAM, serial port, ethernet port, SD-card and a few other
peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the Freescale/IMX50EVK uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select the uClibc when building. The build will
generate 2 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/ukernel.bin
and images/urootfs.bin.

You can load onto the IMX50EVK using the usual uboot loader do this installed
in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot serial port prompt,
by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    set ipaddr 192.168.0.111
    set serverip 192.168.0.22
    set bootargs console=ttymxc0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x72000000,8M
    tftp 0x70800000 ukernel.bin
    tftp 0x71ffffc0 urootfs.bin
    bootm 0x70800000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses 192.168.0.0/24, and
a tftp server at 192.168.0.22. Adjust the above commands as necessary for
your different network setup.

The console will be the serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1).
