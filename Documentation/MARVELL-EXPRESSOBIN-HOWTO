Marvell ExpressoBin
-------------------

The Marvell ExpressoBin evaluation kit is based around the Marvell
Armada 3700 (dual core ARM64) SoC. It has 1Gb of RAM, serial port,
ethernet port3, SD-card and a few other peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the Marvell/ExpressoBin accelerated
target. The default is to select the glibc when building. The build will
generate 3 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/kernel.bin,
images/rootfs.bin and images/armada-3720-espressobin.dtb.

You can load onto the ExpressoBin board using the usual uboot loader do this
installed in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot serial
port prompt, by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    setenv bootargs $console root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x8000000,24M
    dhcp kernel.bin
    tftp 0x8000000 rootfs.bin
    tftp 0x1500000 armada-3720-espressobin.dtb
    booti 0x5000000 - 0x1500000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses 192.168.0.0/24, and
a tftp server at 192.168.0.22. Adjust the above commands as necessary for
your different network setup.

The console is the USB debug serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1).
