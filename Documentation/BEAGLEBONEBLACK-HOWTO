(TI) BeagleBone BLACK
---------------------

The (TI) BeagleBone BLACK board is based around the TI Sitara 33xx SoC.
It has 512Mb of RAM, serial port, ethernet port, SD-card and a few other
peripherals fitted.

Generate images for this board using the TI/BeagleBoneBLACK uClinux-dist
target. The default is to select uClibc when building. The build will
generate 2 binaries that we can then load onto the board, images/ukernel.bin
and images/urootfs.bin.

You can load onto the BeagleBone BLACK using the usual uboot loader that
is installed in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot
serial port prompt, by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

Use the following example commands to load and run:

    set ipaddr 192.168.0.111
    set serverip 192.168.0.106
    set bootargs console=ttyO0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x88080000,16M
    tftp 0x82000000 ukernel.bin
    tftp 0x8807ffc0 urootfs.bin
    bootm 0x82000000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses 192.168.0.0/24, and
a tftp server at 192.168.0.106. Adjust the above commands as necessary for
your different network setup.

The console will be the serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1). Note
that the console device is tty followed by a capital letter 'O' and then
the number '0' (zero).
