Intel Monte Jade IXP425 Demonstration Platform
----------------------------------------------

1. Compiler Tool Chain

   Before you can compile the Linux kernel, libraries and applications to
   generate a Monte Jade image you must install an appropriate compiler tool
   chain. I suggest you use the arm-linux tool chain that accompanies this
   source distribution (the arm-linux-tools-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz package). You can
   also get this tool chain from the http://www.snapgear.org/downloads web
   site. To install this toolchain do:

   1. login as root
   2. cd /
   3. tar xvzf arm-linux-tools-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz

   This package contains binaries of the following GNU tools:

        binutils (as of this writing version 2.14)
        gcc (as of this writing version 3.3.2)
        glibc (as of this writing version 2.2.5)

2. Building the Source

   Follow these simple steps to compile binary images ready to run on the
   Intel Monte Jade board:

   1.  tar xvzf uClinux-dist-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz
   2.  cd uClinux-dist
   3.  make xconfig

       . Choose the "Target Platform Selection" menu item
       . Select the "Vendor/Product" tab and choose "Intel/MonteJade"
       . Select the "Libc version" tab and choose "Glibc"
       . "Save and Exit" this configuration

   4.  make dep
   5.  make

   That is it!  The final make step will run through and compile the Linux
   kernel, glibc library and a sample application set. It will also package
   the result into two files ready to load onto the Monte Jade board, zImage
   and ramdisk.gz.

   The latest linux kernel is currently used on the Monte Jade board.
   Either glibc or uClibc library can be used.


3.  Loading and Running

    You will need the Intel Monte Jade board fitted with the RedBoot loader
    in flash. You should firstly setup RedBoot configuration with a client
    and server IP address (alternatively you can use the builtin DHCP
    support).

    Copy the binary files from uClinux-dist, images/zImage and
    images/ramdisk.gz to the TFTP area of the download server.

    To load and run Linux with directly from RAM issue the following commands:

        load -r -v -b 0x01600000 zImage
        load -r -v -b 0x00800000 ramdisk.gz
        go  -n 0x01600000

    You should see the Linux boot banner, and then be presented with a
    bash shell prompt. A reasonable utility set is in place, mostly using
    the busybox tool set. 


4. Saving to Flash with RedBoot

   You can setup the flash memory to contain the newly build binaries
   instead of the pre-installed SnapGear Linux that is included on the
   Monte Jade board.

   The following procedure describes howto setup and load Linux into
   the flash:

     load -r -v -b 0x01600000 zImage
     fis write -f 0x50080000 -b 0x01600000 -l 0x100000
     load -r -v -b 0x00800000 ramdisk.gz
     fis write -f 0x50180000 -b 0x00800000 -l 0x600000

   The default boot script and other Redboot setup does not need to be
   changed. On the next reboot the system will be running the new images.


5. Customizing the Build

   Using "make xconfig" in uClinux-dist you can customize the kernel and
   application configurations. There is a large selection of packages in
   the application configuration.

   Consult the README file at the top level of uClinux-dist for some more
   information about configuration and building.
