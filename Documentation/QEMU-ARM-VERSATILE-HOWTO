QEMU Emulation of ARM Versatile-PB Evaluation Board
---------------------------------------------------

The QEMU emulator has machine support for the ARM/Versatile-PB board and
ARM926EJ-S CPU. The ARM/Versatile-PB target images can be run in qemu.


BOOTING
-------

Quite simply to run the generated images do:

  qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -kernel images/zImage -initrd images/rootfs.bin -dtb linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/versatile-pb.dtb -append root=/dev/ram0

Qemu will open a new window with the console device of the emulated
versatile board, and it will boot up the the usual Linux shell prompt.

If you want to boot up with a serial console then do:

  qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -nographic -kernel images/zImage -initrd images/rootfs.bin -dtb linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/arm/versatile-pb.dtb -append "root=/dev/ram0 console=ttyAMA0,115200"

The serial console output with come out on the same device that run on.


BOOTING - NO MMU LINUX
----------------------

You can run in no-MMU mode on the Versatile board too. It is basically the
same as running the normal VM kernel. Build for the ARM/Versatile-PB-noMMU
target.

  qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -nographic -kernel images/zImage -dtb linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/arm/versatile-pb.dtb -append "console=ttyAMA0,115200"

The serial console output will come out on the same terminal device that
you ran qemu from.
