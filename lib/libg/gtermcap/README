This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
independent of the terminal type.  Most of this package is also
distributed with GNU Emacs, but it is available in this separate
distribution to make it easier to install as -ltermcap.

The GNU termcap library does not place an arbitrary limit on the size
of termcap entries, unlike most other termcap libraries.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Please report any bugs in this library to bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu.
You can check which version of the library you have by using the RCS
`ident' command on libtermcap.a.
