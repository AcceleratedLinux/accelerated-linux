@deftypefun {int} {tld_check_4} (const uint32_t * @var{in}, size_t @var{inlen}, size_t * @var{errpos}, const Tld_table ** @var{overrides})
@var{in}:  Array of unicode code points to process. Does not need to be
zero terminated.

@var{inlen}:  Number of unicode code points.

@var{errpos}:  Position of offending character is returned here.

@var{overrides}:  An array of additional domain restriction structures
that complement and supersede the built-in information.

Test each of the code points in @code{in} for whether or not they are
allowed by the information in @code{overrides} or by the built-in TLD
restriction data. When data for the same TLD is available both
internally and in @code{overrides}, the information in @code{overrides} takes
precedence. If several entries for a specific TLD are found, the
first one is used.  If @code{overrides} is @var{NULL}, only the built-in
information is used.  The position of the first offending character
is returned in @code{errpos}.

@strong{Return value:}  Returns @var{TLD_SUCCESS} if all code points
are valid or when @code{tld} is null, @var{TLD_INVALID} if a
character is not allowed, or additional error codes on
general failure conditions.
