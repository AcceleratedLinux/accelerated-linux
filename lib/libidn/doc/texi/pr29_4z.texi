@deftypefun {int} {pr29_4z} (const uint32_t * @var{in})
@var{in}:  zero terminated array of Unicode code points.

Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
NFKC specifications.

@strong{Return value:}  Returns PR29_SUCCESS on success, PR29_PROBLEM if the
input sequence is a "problem sequence" (i.e., may be normalized
into different strings by different implementations).
