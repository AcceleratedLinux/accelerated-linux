.SH NAME
tld_check_4
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <tld.h>
.sp
.BI "int tld_check_4(const uint32_t * " in ", size_t " inlen ", size_t * " errpos ", const Tld_table ** " overrides ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint32_t * in" 12
 Array of unicode code points to process. Does not need to be
zero terminated.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
 Number of unicode code points.
.IP "size_t * errpos" 12
 Position of offending character is returned here.
.IP "const Tld_table ** overrides" 12
 An array of additional domain restriction structures
that complement and supersede the built-in information.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Test each of the code points in 
.I "in "
for whether or not they are
allowed by the information in 
.I "overrides "
or by the built-in TLD
restriction data. When data for the same TLD is available both
internally and in 
.I "overrides, "
the information in 
.I "overrides "
takes
precedence. If several entries for a specific TLD are found, the
first one is used.  If 
.I "overrides "
is 
.I "NULL"
, only the built-in
information is used.  The position of the first offending character
is returned in 
.I "errpos."
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
 Returns 
.I "TLD_SUCCESS"
 if all code points
are valid or when 
.I "tld "
is null, 
.I "TLD_INVALID"
 if a
character is not allowed, or additional error codes on
general failure conditions.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
