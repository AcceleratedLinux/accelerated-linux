.SH NAME
idna_to_unicode_44i
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idna.h>
.sp
.BI "int idna_to_unicode_44i(const uint32_t * " in ", size_t " inlen ", uint32_t * " out ", size_t * " outlen ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint32_t * in" 12
 input array with unicode code points.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
 length of input array with unicode code points.
.IP "uint32_t * out" 12
 output array with unicode code points.
.IP "size_t * outlen" 12
 on input, maximum size of output array with unicode code points,
on exit, actual size of output array with unicode code points.
.IP "int flags" 12
 IDNA flags, e.g. IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED or IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ToUnicode operation takes a sequence of Unicode code points
that make up one label and returns a sequence of Unicode code
points. If the input sequence is a label in ACE form, then the
result is an equivalent internationalized label that is not in ACE
form, otherwise the original sequence is returned unaltered.

ToUnicode never fails. If any step fails, then the original input
sequence is returned immediately in that step.

The Punycode decoder can never output more code points than it
inputs, but Nameprep can, and therefore ToUnicode can.  Note that
the number of octets needed to represent a sequence of code points
depends on the particular character encoding used.

The inputs to ToUnicode are a sequence of code points, the
AllowUnassigned flag, and the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag. The output of
ToUnicode is always a sequence of Unicode code points.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
 Returns error condition, but it must only be used for
debugging purposes.  The output buffer is always
guaranteed to contain the correct data according to
the specification (sans malloc induced errors).  NB!
This means that you normally ignore the return code
from this function, as checking it means breaking the
standard.
