.SH NAME
idna_to_ascii_4i
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idna.h>
.sp
.BI "int idna_to_ascii_4i(const uint32_t * " in ", size_t " inlen ", char * " out ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint32_t * in" 12
 input array with unicode code points.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
 length of input array with unicode code points.
.IP "char * out" 12
 output zero terminated string that must have room for at
least 63 characters plus the terminating zero.
.IP "int flags" 12
 IDNA flags, e.g. IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED or IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ToASCII operation takes a sequence of Unicode code points that make
up one label and transforms it into a sequence of code points in the
ASCII range (0..7F). If ToASCII succeeds, the original sequence and the
resulting sequence are equivalent labels.

It is important to note that the ToASCII operation can fail. ToASCII
fails if any step of it fails. If any step of the ToASCII operation
fails on any label in a domain name, that domain name MUST NOT be used
as an internationalized domain name. The method for deadling with this
failure is application-specific.

The inputs to ToASCII are a sequence of code points, the AllowUnassigned
flag, and the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag. The output of ToASCII is either a
sequence of ASCII code points or a failure condition.

ToASCII never alters a sequence of code points that are all in the ASCII
range to begin with (although it could fail). Applying the ToASCII
operation multiple times has exactly the same effect as applying it just
once.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
 Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
