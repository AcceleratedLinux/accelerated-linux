electric-fence for DEBIAN
-------------------------

This package has been orphaned for a while now, so Matthew Vernon
<matthew@debian.org> has taken it up (the next paragraph is superceded by
this one). Note also that I've moved the manpage back to libefence.3

The official maintainer of this package is Siggy Brentrup <bsb@debian.org>.
But he apparently lost his net.access, so this version was made
by joost witteveen, <joostje@debian.org>. 

This package now also contains a shared library of electric fence.
Thus, you don't need to recompile any programmes any more, all
you need to do is

LD_PRELOAD=libefence.so.0.0  your-buggy-programme

and efence's malloc will be used.

Oh, and note that if you're using c++, you and want to statically link
your c++ programmes, you shouldn't use g++ to link libefence.a, but
rather
    gcc -o myprog myprog.o -lstdc++ -lg++ -lefence 
(if you use g++, the order is different, and efence's malloc doesn't get used)
