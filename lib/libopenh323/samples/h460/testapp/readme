*** H.323 Instant Messaging

**********************

This example shows how to use H460 to create your own custom feature in H.323

H323 IM
This example shows how you can send instant messages in and outside a call.

To Send Message to a H.323 endpoint outside a call
t {number or ip} ' {message} '

If you include the message then the endpoint will call the remote endpoint 
send the message and hangup else it will open an IM session. To end the session
send 
H323>t 
This will also end the call.

To establish an IM session within a call
H323>t 
and to end send it again.

If you are not in an IM session then input is sent as userinput to the remote EP.
