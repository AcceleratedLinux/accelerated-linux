/************ Change log
 *
 * $Log: dct.h,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2003/03/14 07:25:55  robertj
 * Removed $header keyword so is not different on alternate repositories
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/05/17 01:47:33  dereks
 * backout the integer maths in the h261 codec.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/10/14 21:48:45  dereks
 * Change vic's fdct() from floating-point to fix-point. Improves performance
 * for h261 video significantly on some machines. Thanks to Cosmos Jiang
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/08/25 03:18:49  dereks
 * Add change log facility (Thanks Robert for the info on implementation)
