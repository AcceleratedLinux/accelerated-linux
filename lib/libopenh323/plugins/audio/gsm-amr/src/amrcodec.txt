This plugin implements an interface to the AMR-NB codec for OpenH323.

For licensing reasons, the amr codec itself is not distributed with this
plugin. Instead, you must download it yourself from
http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/26_series/26.104/26104-610.zip

Unzip that file, and unzip the file 26104-610_ANSI_C_source_code.zip within
it into this directory.
