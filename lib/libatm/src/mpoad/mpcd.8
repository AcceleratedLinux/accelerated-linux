.SH DESCRIPTION
MPOA client
.SM(MPC) is responsible for creating and receiving
internetwork layer shortcuts. Using these shortcuts MPCs forward
unicast internetwork layer packets effectively over ATM without need
for routing protocols.
.PP
.SM MPC
has two roles; ingress and egress. In ingress role
.SM MPC
detects flows destined outside it's own subnet and tries to establish
shortcuts to those destinations. In egress role
.SM MPC
accepts shortcuts and packets arriving on those shortcuts. Maintaining
shortcuts is done with the help of
.SM MPOA
server
.SM(MPS).
.PP
Just as the Linux
.SM LAN
Emulation client,
.SM MPOA
client is also divided in two parts. The parts are kernel component
and a daemon process. The daemon opens and receives data shortcuts and
control connections with the kernel component. The kernel component
tallies packets flowing out from the
.SM LANE
device and makes the decision if a packet should be forwarded using
.SM LANE
or
.SM MPOA
shortcuts.
.PP
If the daemon is killed with
.B SIGHUP
it will close all the open connections, purge ingress and egress cache
entries, query
.SM LECS
if applicable and then restart itself.
.PP
Linux MPOA client only supports non-LLC-muxed shortcuts. The number of 
supported MPOA clients is unlimited.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s Control ATM address"
Local ATM address this MPC uses for MPOA control connections.
.IP "-l Data ATM address"
Local ATM address from and to which MPOA shortcuts are established.
.IP "-c MPS control ATM address"
ATM address of MPS. Only needed if MPS can not advertise it by itself.
.IP "-i Interface number"
The interface number of LEC this MPC serves. E.g. 2 for "lec2".
.IP "-m MPS MAC address"
MAC address of default router where MPS recides. Only useful if the
MPOA server fails to advertise itself.
.IP "-L LEC address"
Listen address of the
.SM LANE
client zeppelin. mpcd uses this address as its own
.SM ATM
address when it queries
.SM LECS
for
.SM MPC
configuration parameters. If this option is not present then mpcd
.B will not
use
.SM LECS
to query for configuration parameters. This option is normally the
same as zeppelin's -l option.
.IP "-n ELAN name"
Name of the
.SM ELAN
for which mpcd asks for parameters when it connects to
.SM LECS.
If this option is not given,
.SM LECS
should respond with parameters belonging to the default
.SM ELAN
if one exists. This option is normally the same as zeppelin's -n
option.
.IP "-C LECS address"
ATM address of
.SM LECS
mpcd asks for parameters. If this option is left empty and -L is
given, mpcd uses ATM Forum assigned Well-Known
.SM LECS
address. This option is normally the same as zeppelin's -c option.
.SH EXAMPLES
This script snippet shows how to run LANE and MPOA. After UNI
signalling and ILMI have been started LANE (zeppelin) and MPOA (mpcd)
are started. The commented out line shows how to start mpcd so that it
queries
.SM LECS
for
.SM MPC
parameters.
.PP
Arguments jaarli[1-3] are local ATM addresses listed in file
.I /etc/hosts.atm.
