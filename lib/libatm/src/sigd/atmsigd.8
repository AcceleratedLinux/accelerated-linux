.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBatmsigd\fP implements the ATM UNI signaling protocol. Requests to
establish, accept, or close ATM SVCs are sent from the kernel (using a
comparably simple protocol) to the signaling demon, which then performs
the dialog with the network.
.P
Note that \fBatmsigd\fP is not able to accept or establish connections
until the local ATM address of the interface is configured by \fBilmid\fP
or manually using \fBatmaddr\fP.
.P
The default signaling VC (interface 0, VPI 0, VCI 5) can be overridden on
the command line by specifying a different PVC address.
.P
When overriding the default VC, optionally a pair of named pipes to use for
communicating with the user of signaling can be specified. Normally, the
kernel is the user of signaling and \fBatmsigd\fP opens a special socket for
communication with it.
.P
If \fBatmsigd\fP is killed, all system calls requiring interaction with it
will return with an error and set \fBerrno\fP to \fBEUNATCH\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-b\fP
Run in background (i.e. in a forked child process) after initializing.
.IP \fB\-c\ \fIconfig_file\fP
Use the specified configuration file instead of \fB/etc/atmsigd.conf\fP
If an option is specified in the configuration file and on the command
line, the command line has priority.
.IP \fB\-d\fP
Enables (lots of) debugging output. By default, \fBatmsigd\fP is comparably
quiet.
.IP \fB\-D\ \fIdump_dir\fP
Specifies the directory to which \fBatmsigd\fP will write status and trace
dumps. If \fB\-D\fP is not specified, dumps are written to /var/tmp.
.IP \fB\-l\ \fIlogfile\fP
Write diagnostic messages to the specified file. The special name
\fBsyslog\fP is used to send diagnostics to the system logger, \fBstderr\fP
is used to send diagnostics to standard error. If \fB\-l\fP is absent, the
setting in \fBatmsigd.conf\fP is used. If \fBatmsigd\fP doesn't specify a
destination either, messages are written to standard error.
.IP \fB\-m\ \fImode\fP
Set the mode of operation. The following modes are available: \fBuser\fP for
the user side (the default), \fBnetwork\fP for the network side (useful if you
have two PCs but no switch), and \fBswitch\fP for operation with a signaling
relay in a switch.
.IP \fB\-n\fP
Prints addresses in numeric format only, i.e. no address to name translation
is attempted.
.IP \fB\-q\ \fIqos\fP
Configures the signaling VC to use the specified quality of service (see
qos(7) for the syntax).
By default, UBR at link speed is used on the signaling VC.
.IP \fB\-t\ \fItrace_length\fP
Sets the number of entries that should be kept in the trace buffer.
\fB\-t 0\fP disables tracing. If \fB\-t\fP is not specified, \fBatmsigd\fP
uses a default of 20 trace entries.
.IP \fB\-u\ \fIuni_version\fP
Sets the signaling mode. The following modes are supported: \fBuni30\fP for
UNI 3.0, \fBuni31\fP for UNI 3.1, \fBuni31+uni30\fP for UNI 3.1 with 3.0
compatibility, \fBuni40\fP for UNI 4.0, and \fBuni40+q.2963.1\fP for UNI 4.0
with Q.2963.1 peak cell rate renegotiation.
.IP \fB\-V\fP
Prints the version number of \fBatmsigd\fP on standard output and exits.

.SH DEBUGGING
When receiving a \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal, \fBatmsigd\fP dumps the list of all
internal socket descriptors. With \fBSIGUSR2\fP, it dumps the contents of
the trace buffer. If a dump directory was set, dumps are written to files
called \fBatmsigd.\fP\fIpid\fP\fB.status.\fP\fInumber\fP and
\fBatmsigd.\fP\fIpid\fP\fB.trace.\fP\fInumber\fP, respectively, with
\fInumber\fP
starting at zero and being incremented for every dump. If no dump directory
is set, dumps are written to standard error.
.P
Dumps are also generated whenever \fBatmsigd\fP detects a fatal error and
terminates. No attempt is made to catch signals like \fBSIGSEGV\fP.
.SH BUGS
The generation of traces is a comparably slow
process which may already take several seconds for only 100 trace entries.
To generate a trace dump, \fBatmsigd\fP therefore forks a child process that
runs in parallel to the signaling demon.
