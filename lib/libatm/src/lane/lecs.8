.SH NAME
les, bus \- ATM LAN Emulation service demons
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lecs
.RB [ \-l\ \fIlisten_address\fP ]
.RB [ \-f\ \fIconfiguration_file\fP ]
.RB [ \-d\ ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
LE Service consists of three components: LAN Emulation Configuration 
Server (\fBlecs\fP), LAN Emulation Server (
\fBles(8)\fP) and Broadcast and Unknown Server (\fBbus(8)\fP).
.PP
\fBLecs\fP implements the distribution of LECs to different emulated 
LANs. This is done by giving different LAN Emulation Server ATM addresses 
to LECs. Distribution is based on \fBlecs\fP's configuration database 
and information provided by the LE client. It is not required that a 
\fBlecs\fP exists for all emulated LANs. It is possible to bypass this 
configuration phase by directly telling ATM address of the \fBles(8)\fP to 
the LEC.

Configuration file example for \fBlecs\fP:
.in +2m
.nf
# Our ATM address (should be included to differentiate us from 
# e.g. LEC)
# Must be before ELAN definitions
470023000000030300010002010020ea000ae905

# ELAN name is inside brackets.
# Parameters below are for Ethernet type LE (Linux & almost all 
# other LE clients)

# Address of the LES
LES:=470023000000030300010002010020ea000ae901
# 802_3 or 802_5 (802_3 = Ethernet)
Type:=802_3
# 1515, 4544, 9234 or 18190 (1516= Ethernet)
Max_Frame:=1516

# ATM address for hosts that are guided to this ELAN. 
# Wildcard is x or X.

Rules for finding ELAN definitions using information provided in 
LE_CONFIGURE_REQUEST and the configuration file are as follows:
.PP

.in +2m
.nf
1. Find an entry where ELAN-NAME matches exactly and an 
   ATM address of the LEC is found in ELAN definition. 
   These are to match exactly with the information given in 
   LE_CONFIGURE_REQUEST. If ELAN-NAME is found, but ATM 
   address doesn't match then reject with reason "Permission 
   denied".
2. Search for first ELAN which matches in type of emulated LAN, 
   maximum frame size and ATM address of the LEC.
3. If matching ELAN was not found, return default ELAN 
   definitions.
4. No match, so request is rejected with reason "No 
   Configuration".
