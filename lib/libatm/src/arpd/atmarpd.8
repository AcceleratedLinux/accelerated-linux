.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBatmarpd\fP implements the ATMARP protocol as specified in RFC1577 and
RFC1755. Address resolution requests are sent from the kernel (using a
comparably simple protocol) to the ATMARP demon, which then performs
the dialog with the network.
.P
\fBatmarpd\fP can operate as an ATMARP client and as an ATMARP server.
If also supports the concurrent use of several IP over ATM interfaces.
.P
\fBatmarpd\fP is configured from the command line using the \fBatmarp\fP
program. Unless debugging is enabled, the ATMARP table is written after
every change to the file \fB/var/run/atmarpd.table\fP (or to a file with
the same name in a different directory, if the \fB\-D\fP option is
used).
.P
Note that \fBatmarpd\fP disables support for SVCs if signaling is not
available at start time, i.e. if \fBatmsigd\fP is not running.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-b\fP
Run in background (i.e. in a forked child process) after initializing.
.IP \fB\-d\fP
Enables (lots of) debugging output. By default, \fBatmarpd\fP is comparably
quiet.
.IP \fB\-D\ \fIdump_dir\fP
Changes the directory where \fBatmarpd\fP writes its table
(\fBatmarpd.table\fP). By default, \fB/var/run\fP is used.
.IP \fB\-l\ \fIlogfile\fP
Write diagnostic messages to the specified file instead of to standard
error. The special name \fBsyslog\fP is used to send diagnostics to the
system logger.
.IP \fB\-m\fP
Enables merging of incoming calls if the address is known. 
An incoming connection on which no InARP reply has been received yet, but
which originates from an ATM address for which an ATMARP entry already
exists, is automatically added to that entry. This assumes that there is a
1:1 mapping between IP addresses and ATMARP addresses. By default, this
assumption is not made, which frequently results in the setup of duplicate
connections. Note that RFC1577 requires that an ATMARP server sends an InARP
request on an incoming connection. Merging may therefore violate RFC1577 in
this case.
.IP \fB\-n\fP
Prints addresses in numeric format only, i.e. no address to name translation
is attempted.
.IP \fB\-V\fP
Prints the version number of \fBatmarpd\fP on standard output and exits.
.SH FILES
.PD 0

.B /var/run/atmarpd.table
ATMARP table
.TP 25
.B /proc/atm/arp

.PD
.SH BUGS
\fBatmarpd\fP removes ATMARP entries from the kernel table while refreshing
them.
