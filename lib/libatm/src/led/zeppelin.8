.SH DESCRIPTION
A LAN Emulation Client is an entity in an ATM endstation that performs 
data forwarding, address resolution and other control functions. It 
uses the LUNI interface when communicating with other components in 
emulated LANs. It provides upper protocol layers a MAC like 
interface similar to IEEE 802.3/Ethernet or IEEE 802.5/Token Ring LAN.
.PP
LAN Emulation client code is divided into two parts: user space 
application LAN Emulation Demon called (LED) \fBzeppelin(8)\fP, and the 
kernel component. \fBZeppelin\fP is responsible for control operations needed 
in LAN Emulation clienthood. It forms the necessary VCCs and receives 
all the LE control frames and acts accordingly. It also controls the 
operation of the LEC kernel component.
.PP
Linux LEC supports only Ethernet type of emulated LAN.
.PP
\fBSIGHUP\fP causes restart of the LEC. All resources are 
released and \fBzeppelin\fP is started. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-c\ \fILECS_address\fP
ATM address of \fBlecs(8)\fP (Lan Emulation Configuration Server), if not
set, Well-Known server address is used.
.IP \fB\-s\ \fILES_address\fP
ATM address of \fBles(8)\fP (Lan Emulation Server), can be used in
bypassing configuration phase in joining emulated Lan i.e \fBlecs\fP address
is not used. 
.IP \fB\-e\ \fIesi\fP
Mac address to use when communicating in Emulated LAN. E.g. 00:20:22:23:04:05 .
.IP \fB\-n\ \fIVLAN_name\fP
Name of the virtual LAN to which joining is requested.
This is used in LE_CONFIGURE_REQUEST to LECS or
LE_JOIN_RESPONSE to LES, if configuration phase is bypassed.
.IP \fB\-m\ \fImesg_mask\fP
Sometimes one wants to know more what is happening in LE
daemon e.g. when nothing works. This is a hexadecimal long value
setting global message mask. 0 = No messages, ffff = All messages.
.IP \fB\-l\ \fIlisten_address\ |\ selector\fP
Local ATM address that zeppelin uses as local binding point in
signalling. Use this if you are running more than one client or
a set of LE servers. The local ATM address can be specified by
either giving the full ATM address or the desired selector byte.
.IP \fB\-i\ \fIinterface_number\fP
Linux LEC supports up to 40+8 network interfaces. The interface_number
tells zeppelin to which of these to attach. Ethernet type network
interfaces are numbered from "lec0" to "lec39" and Token Ring
interfaces are from "lec40" to "lec47". These parameters are tweakable
during the kernel compile, see <linux/atmlec.h>.
.IP \fB\-I\ \fIphysical_interface_number\fP
The physical interface this LANE client should bind to. If your host
has multiple ATM network cards, you can use this option to choose
which card this zeppelin will use.
.IP \fB\-t\ \fIMTU\fP
The MTU of ELAN to join. You need to also use \fBifconfig(8)\fP to
set the MTU of the LANE interface.
.IP \fB\-1\fP
Run as LANEv1 client. This is the default.
.IP \fB\-2\fP
Run as LANEv2 client. This is required by MPOA.
.IP \fB\-p\fP
Enable proxy. When started with this option, it is possible to bridge
packets between ATM and Ethernet. That is, you can use LANE interfaces
with normal bridging. See the Bridging mini-Howto for more info.
.IP \fB\-F\ \fIlogfile\fP
Instead of writing debug messages to \fBstderr\fP, write the messages
to the file \fBlogfile\fP. Use \fBsyslog\fP as the file name to use
the \fBsyslog(3)\fP facility.
.IP \fB\-f\ \fIFore\ specific\ name\fP
The LANE servers on Fore ATM switches can display a special
name if a client can supply one. This name shows with command
\'conf lane les show advanced\'.
.SH TOKEN RING CONSIDERATIONS
A number of lec interfaces is reserved for Token Ring ELANs when the
kernel is compiled with Token Ring (CONFIG_TR) support. See the
discussion about interface_number command line option above. The Linux
Token Ring LANE client does not support bridging between legacy Token
Ring and ATM parts of the ELAN, so using the -p option is not
recommended. Token Ring support has received less testing than its
Ethernet counterpart.
.SH BUGS
John Bonham died 1980 and Led Zeppelin broke.
