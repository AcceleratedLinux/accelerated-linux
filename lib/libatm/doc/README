In order to build the documentation just do:

make my_favorite_doc_type

Where my_favorite_doc_type is one of:

html - HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
txt  - ASCII plain text
rtf  - Rich Text Format
ps   - Postscript
pdf  - Portable Document Format (PDF)

SGMLtools-Lite (http://sgmltools-lite.sourceforge.net/) is used to create the
HTML, text, and Postscript verions of the documentation as it does the best
overall job of creating those document types.  It won't work if you wish to
create the RTF or PDF versions of the document.  You will need the
Cygnus DocBook Tools available from RedHat (http://www.redhat.com/) if you
wish to create those document types.
