/*
 * In queries without qf_quoteok_*, all domains must have standard
 * legal syntax, or you get adns_s_querydomainvalid (if the query
 * domain contains bad characters) or adns_s_answerdomaininvalid (if
 * the answer contains bad characters).
 * 
 * In queries _with_ qf_quoteok_*, domains in the query or response
 * may contain any characters, quoted according to RFC1035 5.1.  On
 * input to adns, the char* is a pointer to the interior of a "
 * delimited string, except that " may appear in it unquoted.  On
 * output, the char* is a pointer to a string which would be legal
 * either inside or outside " delimiters; any character which isn't
 * legal in a hostname (ie alphanumeric or hyphen) or one of _ / +
 * (the three other punctuation characters commonly abused in domain
 * names) will be quoted, as \X if it is a printing ASCII character or
 * \DDD otherwise.
 *
 * If the query goes via a CNAME then the canonical name (ie, the
 * thing that the CNAME record refers to) is usually allowed to
 * contain any characters, which will be quoted as above.  With
 * adns_qf_quotefail_cname you get adns_s_answerdomaininvalid when
 * this happens.  (This is a change from version 0.4 and earlier, in
 * which failing the query was the default, and you had to say
 * adns_qf_quoteok_cname to avoid this; that flag is now deprecated.)
 *
 * In version 0.4 and earlier, asking for _raw records containing
 * mailboxes without specifying _qf_quoteok_anshost was silly.  This
 * is no longer the case.  In this version only parts of responses
 * that are actually supposed to be hostnames will be refused by
 * default if quote-requiring characters are found.
 */

/*
 * If you ask for an RR which contains domains which are actually
 * encoded mailboxes, and don't ask for the _raw version, then adns
 * returns the mailbox formatted suitably for an RFC822 recipient
 * header field.  The particular format used is that if the mailbox
 * requires quoting according to the rules in RFC822 then the
 * local-part is quoted in double quotes, which end at the next
 * unescaped double quote (\ is the escape char, and is doubled, and
 * is used to escape only \ and ").  If the local-part is legal
 * without quoting according to RFC822, it is presented as-is.  In any
 * case the local-part is followed by an @ and the domain.  The domain
 * will not contain any characters not legal in hostnames.
 *
 * Unquoted local-parts may contain any printing 7-bit ASCII
 * except the punctuation characters ( ) < > @ , ; : \ " [ ]
 * I.e. they may contain alphanumerics, and the following
 * punctuation characters:  ! # % ^ & * - _ = + { } .
 *
 * adns will reject local parts containing control characters (byte
 * values 0-31, 127-159, and 255) - these appear to be legal according
 * to RFC822 (at least 0-127) but are clearly a bad idea.  RFC1035
 * syntax does not make any distinction between a single RFC822
 * quoted-string containing full stops, and a series of quoted-strings
 * separated by full stops; adns will return anything that isn't all
 * valid atoms as a single quoted-string.  RFC822 does not allow
 * high-bit-set characters at all, but adns does allow them in
 * local-parts, treating them as needing quoting.
 *
 * If you ask for the domain with _raw then _no_ checking is done
 * (even on the host part, regardless of adns_qf_quoteok_anshost), and
 * you just get the domain name in master file format.
 *
 * If no mailbox is supplied the returned string will be `.' in either
 * case.

/* Configuration:
 *  adns_init reads /etc/resolv.conf, which is expected to be (broadly
 *  speaking) in the format expected by libresolv, and then
 *  /etc/resolv-adns.conf if it exists.  adns_init_strcfg is instead
 *  passed a string which is interpreted as if it were the contents of
 *  resolv.conf or resolv-adns.conf.  In general, configuration which
 *  is set later overrides any that is set earlier.
 *
 * Standard directives understood in resolv[-adns].conf:
 * 
 *  nameserver <address>
 *   Must be followed by the IP address of a nameserver.  Several
 *   nameservers may be specified, and they will be tried in the order
 *   found.  There is a compiled in limit, currently 5, on the number
 *   of nameservers.  (libresolv supports only 3 nameservers.)
 *
 *  search <domain> ...
 *   Specifies the search list for queries which specify
 *   adns_qf_search.  This is a list of domains to append to the query
 *   domain.  The query domain will be tried as-is either before all
 *   of these or after them, depending on the ndots option setting
 *   (see below).
 *
 *  domain <domain>
 *   This is present only for backward compatibility with obsolete
 *   versions of libresolv.  It should not be used, and is interpreted
 *   by adns as if it were `search' - note that this is subtly
 *   different to libresolv's interpretation of this directive.
 *
 *  sortlist <addr>/<mask> ...
 *   Should be followed by a sequence of IP-address and netmask pairs,
 *   separated by spaces.  They may be specified as
 *   eg. 172.30.206.0/24 or 172.30.206.0/255.255.255.0.  Currently up
 *   to 15 pairs may be specified (but note that libresolv only
 *   supports up to 10).
 *
 *  options
 *   Should followed by one or more options, separated by spaces.
 *   Each option consists of an option name, followed by optionally
 *   a colon and a value.  Options are listed below.
 *
 * Non-standard directives understood in resolv[-adns].conf:
 *
 *  clearnameservers
 *   Clears the list of nameservers, so that further nameserver lines
 *   start again from the beginning.
 *
 *  include <filename>
 *   The specified file will be read.
 *
 * Additionally, adns will ignore lines in resolv[-adns].conf which
 * start with a #.
 *
 * Standard options understood:
 *
 *  debug
 *   Enables debugging output from the resolver, which will be written
 *   to stderr.
 *
 *  ndots:<count>
 *   Affects whether queries with adns_qf_search will be tried first
 *   without adding domains from the searchlist, or whether the bare
 *   query domain will be tried last.  Queries which contain at least
 *   <count> dots will be tried bare first.  The default is 1.
 *
 * Non-standard options understood:
 *
 *  adns_checkc:none
 *  adns_checkc:entex
 *  adns_checkc:freq
 *   Changes the consistency checking frequency; this overrides the
 *   setting of adns_if_check_entex, adns_if_check_freq, or neither,
 *   in the flags passed to adns_init.
 * 
 * There are a number of environment variables which can modify the
 * behaviour of adns.  They take effect only if adns_init is used, and
 * the caller of adns_init can disable them using adns_if_noenv.  In
 * each case there is both a FOO and an ADNS_FOO; the latter is
 * interpreted later so that it can override the former.  Unless
 * otherwise stated, environment variables are interpreted after
 * resolv[-adns].conf are read, in the order they are listed here.
 *
 *  RES_CONF, ADNS_RES_CONF
 *   A filename, whose contets are in the format of resolv.conf.
 *
 *  RES_CONF_TEXT, ADNS_RES_CONF_TEXT
 *   A string in the format of resolv.conf.
 *
 *  RES_OPTIONS, ADNS_RES_OPTIONS
 *   These are parsed as if they appeared in the `options' line of a
 *   resolv.conf.  In addition to being parsed at this point in the
 *   sequence, they are also parsed at the very beginning before
 *   resolv.conf or any other environment variables are read, so that
 *   any debug option can affect the processing of the configuration.
 *
 *  LOCALDOMAIN, ADNS_LOCALDOMAIN
 *   These are interpreted as if their contents appeared in a `search'
 *   line in resolv.conf.

 *

 * The representation is in two parts: first, a word for the address
 * family (ie, in AF_XXX, the XXX), and then one or more items for the
 * address itself, depending on the format.  For an IPv4 address the
 * syntax is INET followed by the dotted quad (from inet_ntoa).
 * Currently only IPv4 is supported.
 *
 * Text strings (as in adns_rr_txt) appear inside double quotes, and
 * use \" and \\ to represent " and \, and \xHH to represent
 * characters not in the range 32-126.
 *
 * Hostname with addresses (adns_rr_hostaddr): this consists of the
 * hostname, as usual, followed by the adns_status value, as an
 * abbreviation, and then a descriptive string (encoded as if it were
 * a piece of text), for the address lookup, followed by zero or more
 * addresses enclosed in ( and ).  If the result was a temporary
 * failure, then a single ?  appears instead of the ( ).  If the
 * result was a permanent failure then an empty pair of parentheses
 * appears (which a space in between).  For example, one of the NS
 * records for greenend.org.uk comes out like
 *  ns.chiark.greenend.org.uk ok "OK" ( INET 195.224.76.132 )
 * an MX referring to a nonexistent host might come out like:
 *  50 sun2.nsfnet-relay.ac.uk nxdomain "No such domain" ( )

 *  dns2.spong.dyn.ml.org timeout "DNS query timed out" ?
