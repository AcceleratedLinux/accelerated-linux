INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for GNU ADNS

1. Read the security note below.

2. Standard GNU package build process:
   $ ./configure [--disable-dynamic] [--prefix=... ...]
   $ make
   # make install

Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive documentation yet.  For now,
use the comments in the public header file adns.h, and for the C
programs their usage messages.  If you find this information
ambiguous, incomplete or wrong, please report it as a bug.


TESTED PLATFORMS

The following platforms have been tested at at least some point and
should work - please report if they don't:
 adns version  OS
   1.0		Linux glibc 2.1 (actually tested on Debian 2.2)
   1.0		Solaris 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 [3]
   1.0		FreeBSD 3.2, 4.0 (no poll(2), so no adnsresfilter)
The following work, but only with --disable-dynamic:
   1.0		IRIX 6.5 *not* with GCC [1], [2]
   1.0		AIX 4.1.5
   1.0		HP-UX 10.20, 11.00
Later versions of the same OS should work too.  Usually entries in
this table mean adns passes its own regression test, when compiled
with GCC, and appears to install and run correctly.  If you have more
information for this table please let me know.

Notes/known problems:
   [1] IRIX 6.5 inet_ntoa seems to break with GCC.
   [2] The SGI IRIX compiler produces many spurious warnings.
   [3] Dynamically linked, needs some help to find libadns.so.1.0.

The following platforms are known to be deficient and will not work:
   Solaris 2.5			Lacks vsnprintf - install glibc ?
   TruUnix64 (DEC UNIX 4.0f)	Lacks vsnprintf - install glibc ?
Please don't report these problems unless you have a nice,
straightforward solution or workaround for them.  (I don't consider
including a `vsnprintf' implementation nice, so don't send me one.)


PORTABILITY INFORMATION

You will find that adns requires a reasonably standard and up to date
system.  Systems which are neither GNU nor UNIX are not supported.

The build system assumes by default that you have ELF shared
libraries, and that the directory in which libadns.so.1 will be
installed is on your dynamic library search path.  If your system
doesn't have ELF shared libraries then dynamic linking is not
supported by adns.  Use the --disable-shared configure option.
Please don't send me patches to use libtool (which I dislike).

Compilers other than GNU C should work, but are not well-tested.  Feel
free to send me patches to improve the situation.  However, the
Makefiles only know how to use GCC to make dynamic libraries.

The adnsresfilter utility uses `tsearch' from the C library (a la SVID
and X/Open).  If you don't have tsearch configure will arranges for
adnsresfilter not to be built.  To fix this, install a C library
containing tsearch, such as the GNU C library.  It is best if tsearch
uses an automatically-balancing tree algorithm, like the glibc version
does.  Simple binary trees may perform badly.

If you change the m4 input files in regress/ you may need GNU m4.

You will probably find that GNU Make is required.
Please do not report this as a bug; install GNU Make instead.


SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE - AN IMPORTANT NOTE

adns is not a `full-service resolver': it does no caching of responses
at all, and has no defence against bad nameservers or fake packets
which appear to come from your real nameservers.  It relies on the
full-service resolvers listed in resolv.conf to handle these tasks.

For secure and reasonable operation you MUST run a full-service
nameserver on the same system as your adns applications, or on the
same local, fully trusted network.  You MUST only list such
nameservers in the adns configuration (eg resolv.conf).

You MUST use a firewall or other means to block packets which appear
to come from these nameservers, but which were actually sent by other,
untrusted, entities.

Furthermore, adns is not DNSSEC-aware in this version; it doesn't
understand even how to ask a DNSSEC-aware nameserver to perform the
DNSSEC cryptographic signature checking.
