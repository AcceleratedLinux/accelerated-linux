Welcome to the Kerberos password changing GUI.\n\
\n\
In the main window, enter your old password when prompted.  After verifying\n\
your old password, the policy governing your password will be displayed, and\n\
you will be prompted for a new password.  You will then be asked to enter it\n\
a second time, to make sure you have not made any typos.  Assuming that\n\
your new password complies with your password policy, you should receive\n\
an acknowledgement that your password has been changed.\n\
\n\
If an error occurs, the process will start over from the beginning.  You may\n\
exit the application at any time by pressing the "Quit" button.
