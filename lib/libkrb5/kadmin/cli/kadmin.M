.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kadmin
and
.B kadmin.local
are command-line interfaces to the Kerberos V5 KADM5 administration
system.  Both
.B kadmin
and
.B kadmin.local
provide identical functionalities; the difference is that
.B kadmin.local
runs on the master KDC if the database is db2 and
does not use Kerberos to authenticate to the
database. Except as explicitly noted otherwise, 
this man page will use
.B kadmin
to refer to both versions.
.B kadmin
provides for the maintenance of Kerberos principals, KADM5 policies, and
service key tables (keytabs).  
.PP
The remote version uses Kerberos authentication and an encrypted RPC, to
operate securely from anywhere on the network.  It authenticates to the
KADM5 server using the service principal
.IR kadmin/admin .
If the credentials cache contains a ticket for the
.I kadmin/admin
principal, and the 
.B \-c
.I credentials_cache
option is specified, that ticket is used to authenticate to KADM5.
Otherwise, the
.B -p
and
.B -k
options are used to specify the client Kerberos principal name used to
authenticate.  Once
.B kadmin
has determined the principal name, it requests a
.I kadmin/admin
Kerberos service ticket from the KDC, and uses that service ticket to
authenticate to KADM5.
.PP
If the database is db2, the local client
.BR kadmin.local ,
is intended to run directly on the master KDC without Kerberos
authentication.  The local version provides all of the functionality of
the now obsolete
.IR kdb5_edit (8),
except for database dump and load, which is now provided by the
.IR kdb5_util (8)
utility.
.PP
If the database is LDAP, kadmin.local need not be run on the KDC. 
.PP
kadmin.local can be configured to log updates for incremental database
propagation.  Incremental propagation allows slave KDC servers to
receive principal and policy updates incrementally instead of
receiving full dumps of the database.  This facility can be enabled in
the
.I kdc.conf
file with the
.I iprop_enable
option.  See the
.I kdc.conf
documentation for other options for tuning incremental propagation
parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrealm\fP
Use
.I realm
as the default database realm.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIprincipal\fP
Use
.I principal
to authenticate.  Otherwise, kadmin will append "/admin" to the primary
principal name of the default ccache, the value of the
.SM USER
environment variable, or the username as obtained with getpwuid, in
order of preference.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP
Use a keytab to decrypt the KDC response instead of prompting for a
password on the TTY.  In this case, the default principal will be
host/\fIhostname\fP.  If there is not a keytab specified with the
.B \-t
option, then the default keytab will be used.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fIkeytab\fP
Use
.I keytab
to decrypt the KDC response.  This can only be used with the
.B \-k
option.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcredentials_cache\fP
Use
.I credentials_cache
as the credentials cache.  The
.I credentials_cache
should contain a service ticket for the
.I kadmin/admin
service; it can be acquired with the
.IR kinit (1)
program.  If this option is not specified,
.B kadmin
requests a new service ticket from the KDC, and stores it in its own
temporary ccache.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIpassword\fP
Use
.I password
instead of prompting for one on the TTY.  Note:  placing the password
for a Kerberos principal with administration access into a shell script
can be dangerous if unauthorized users gain read access to the script.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP \fIquery\fP
pass
.I query
directly to
.BR kadmin ,
which will perform
.I query
and then exit.  This can be useful for writing scripts.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdbname\fP
Specifies the name of the Kerberos database.
This option does not apply to the LDAP database.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIadmin_server[:port]\fP
Specifies the admin server which kadmin should contact.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Do not authenticate using a keytab.  This option will cause kadmin
to prompt for the master database password.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP \fIenc:salt_list\fP
Sets the list of encryption types and salt types to be used for any new
keys created.
.TP
.B \-O
Force use of old AUTH_GSSAPI authentication flavor.
.TP
.B \-N
Prevent fallback to AUTH_GSSAPI authentication flavor.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP \fIdb_args\fP
Specifies the database specific arguments.

Options supported for LDAP database are:
.RS
.TP
\-x host=<hostname>
specifies the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI.
.TP
\-x binddn=<bind_dn>
.fi
specifies the DN of the object used by the administration server to bind to the LDAP server.
This object should have the read and write rights on the realm container, principal container
and the subtree that is referenced by the realm.
.TP
\-x bindpwd=<bind_password>
.fi
specifies the password for the above mentioned binddn. It is recommended not to use this option.
Instead, the password can be stashed using the stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util.
.RE
.SH DATE FORMAT 
Various commands in kadmin can take a variety of date formats,
specifying durations or absolute times.  Examples of valid formats are:
.sp
.nf
.RS
1 month ago
2 hours ago
400000 seconds ago
last year
this Monday
next Monday
yesterday
tomorrow
now
second Monday
a fortnight ago
3/31/92 10:00:07 PST
January 23, 1987 10:05pm
22:00 GMT
.RE
.fi
.PP
Dates which do not have the "ago" specifier default to being absolute
dates, unless they appear in a field where a duration is expected.  In
that case the time specifier will be interpreted as relative.
Specifying "ago" in a duration may result in unexpected behavior.
.PP
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBadd_principal\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fInewprinc\fP
creates the principal
.IR newprinc ,
prompting twice for a password.  If no policy is specified with the
\-policy option, and the policy named "default" exists, then that
policy is assigned to the principal; note that the assignment of the
policy "default" only occurs automatically when a principal is first
created, so the policy "default" must already exist for the assignment
to occur.  This assignment of "default" can be suppressed with the
\-clearpolicy option.  This command requires the 
.I add
privilege.  This command has the aliases
.B addprinc
and
.BR ank .
The options are:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-x\fP \fIdb_princ_args\fP
Denotes the database specific options. The options for LDAP database are:
.RS
.TP
\-x dn=<dn>
Specifies the LDAP object that will contain the Kerberos principal being 
created.
.TP
\-x linkdn=<dn>
.fi
Specifies the LDAP object to which the newly created Kerberos principal object
will point to.
.TP
\-x containerdn=<container_dn>
Specifies the container object under which the Kerberos principal is to be created.

.B +allow_dup_skey
clears this flag.
.TP
{\fB\-\fP|\fB+\fP}\fBrequires_preauth\fP
.B +requires_preauth
requires this principal to preauthenticate before being allowed to
kinit.  (Sets the
.SM KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH
flag.)
.B -requires_preauth
clears this flag.
.TP
{\fB\-\fP|\fB+\fP}\fBrequires_hwauth\fP

sets the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag on tickets issued for use with this principal
as the service, which clients may use as a hint that credentials can and
should be delegated when authenticating to the service.  (Sets the
.SM KRB5_KDB_OK_AS_DELEGATE
flag.)
.B -ok_as_delegate
clears this flag.
.TP
{\fB\-\fP|\fB+\fP}\fBallow_svr\fP
.B -allow_svr
prohibits the issuance of service tickets for this principal.  (Sets the

flag.)
.B +allow_svr
clears this flag.
.TP
{\fB\-\fP|\fB+\fP}\fBallow_tgs_req\fP
.B \-allow_tgs_req
specifies that a Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) request for a service
ticket for this principal is not permitted.  This option is useless for
most things.
.B +allow_tgs_req
clears this flag.  The default is
.BR +allow_tgs_req .
In effect,
.B \-allow_tgs_req
sets the
.SM KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_TGT_BASED
flag on the principal in the database.
.TP
{\fB\-\fP|\fB+\fP}\fBallow_tix\fP

In effect,
.B +password_changing_service
sets the
.SM KRB5_KDB_PWCHANGE_SERVICE
flag on the principal in the database.
.TP
.B \-randkey
sets the key of the principal to a random value
.TP
\fB\-pw\fP \fIpassword\fP
sets the key of the principal to the specified string and does not
prompt for a password.  Note:  using this option in a shell script can
be dangerous if unauthorized users gain read access to the script.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP \fI"enc:salt ..."\fP
uses the specified list of enctype\-salttype pairs for setting the key
of the principal.  The quotes are necessary if there are multiple
enctype\-salttype pairs.  This will not function against kadmin

[\fB\-norandkey\fP] [[\fIprincipal\fP | \fB\-glob\fP \fIprinc-exp\fP] [\fI...\fP]
.br
Adds a principal or all principals matching
.I princ-exp
to a keytab.
It randomizes each principal's key in the process, to prevent a
compromised admin account from reading out all of the keys from the
database.  However,
.B kadmin.local
has the
.B \-norandkey
option, which leaves the keys and their version numbers unchanged,
similar to the Kerberos V4
.B ext_srvtab
command.
That allows users to continue to use the passwords they know
to login normally, while simultaneously allowing scripts
to login to the same account using a keytab.
There is no significant security risk added since
.B kadmin.local
must be run by root on the KDC anyway.
.sp
Requires the
.I inquire

.I changepw
privileges.  An entry for each of the principal's unique encryption types
is added, ignoring multiple keys with the same encryption type but
different salt types.  If the

argument is not specified, the default keytab
.I /etc/krb5.keytab
is used.  If the

\fBktremove\fP [\fB\-k\fP \fIkeytab\fP] [\fB\-q\fP] \fIprincipal\fP [\fIkvno\fP | \fBall\fP | \fBold\fP]
Removes entries for the specified principal from a keytab.  Requires no
permissions, since this does not require database access.  If the string
"all" is specified, all entries for that principal are removed; if the
string "old" is specified, all entries for that principal except those
with the highest kvno are removed.  Otherwise, the value specified is
parsed as an integer, and all entries whose kvno match that integer are
removed.  If the
.B \-k
argument is not specifeid, the default keytab
.I /etc/krb5.keytab
is used.  If the
.B \-q
option is specified, less verbose status information is displayed.

principal.db
default name for Kerberos principal database
.TP
<dbname>.kadm5
KADM5 administrative database.  (This would be "principal.kadm5", if you
use the default database name.)  Contains policy information.
.TP
<dbname>.kadm5.lock
lock file for the KADM5 administrative database.  This file works
backwards from most other lock files.  I.e.,
.B kadmin
will exit with an error if this file does
.I not
exist.

.B Note:
The above three files are specific to db2 database.
.TP 
kadm5.acl
file containing list of principals and their
.B kadmin
administrative privileges.  See
.IR kadmind (8)
for a description.
.TP
kadm5.keytab
keytab file for

principal.
.TP
kadm5.dict
file containing dictionary of strings explicitly disallowed as
passwords.
.SH HISTORY
The

Command output needs to be cleaned up.

There is no way to delete a key kept around from a "\-keepold" option
to a password-changing command, other than to do a password change
without the "\-keepold" option, which will of course cause problems if
the key is a TGS key.  There will be more powerful key-manipulation
commands in the future.
