.SH DESCRIPTION
.I kinit
obtains and caches an initial ticket-granting ticket for
.IR principal .  
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V
display verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlifetime\fP
requests a ticket with the lifetime
.IR lifetime .
The value for
.I lifetime
must be followed immediately by one of the following delimiters:
.sp
.nf
.in +.3i
\fBs\fP  seconds
\fBm\fP  minutes
\fBh\fP  hours
\fBd\fP  days
.in -.3i
.fi
.sp
as in "kinit -l 90m".  You cannot mix units; a value of `3h30m' will
result in an error.
.sp
If the
.B \-l
option is not specified, the default ticket lifetime (configured by each
site) is used.  Specifying a ticket lifetime longer than the maximum
ticket lifetime (configured by each site) results in a ticket with the
maximum lifetime.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIstart_time\fP
requests a postdated ticket, valid starting at
.IR start_time .
Postdated tickets are issued with the
.I invalid
flag set, and need to be fed back to the kdc before use.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrenewable_life\fP
requests renewable tickets, with a total lifetime of
.IR renewable_life .
The duration is in the same format as the
.B \-l
option, with the same delimiters.
.TP
.B \-f
request forwardable tickets.
.TP
.B \-F
do not request forwardable tickets.
.TP
.B \-p
request proxiable tickets.
.TP
.B \-P
do not request proxiable tickets.
.TP
.B \-a
request tickets with the local address[es].
.TP
.B \-A
request address-less tickets.
.TP
.B \-v
requests that the ticket granting ticket in the cache (with the 
.I invalid
flag set) be passed to the kdc for validation.  If the ticket is within
its requested time range, the cache is replaced with the validated
ticket.
.TP
.B \-R
requests renewal of the ticket-granting ticket.  Note that an expired
ticket cannot be renewed, even if the ticket is still within its
renewable life.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP [\fB\-t\fP \fIkeytab_file\fP]
requests a host ticket, obtained from a key in the local host's
.I keytab
file.  The name and location of the keytab file may be specified with
the
.B \-t
.I keytab_file
option; otherwise the default name and location will be used.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP \fIarmor_ccache\fP
Specifies the name of a credential cache that already contains a
ticket.  This ccache will be used to armor the request.  Ideally, an
attacker should have to attack both the armor ticket and the key of
the principal.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcache_name\fP
use
.I cache_name
as the Kerberos 5 credentials (ticket) cache name and location; if this 
option is not used, the default cache name and location are used.
.sp
The default credentials cache may vary between systems.  If the
.B KRB5CCNAME
environment variable is set, its value is used to name the default
ticket cache.  Any existing contents of the cache are destroyed by
.IR kinit .
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fIservice_name\fP
specify an alternate service name to use when
getting initial tickets.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP \fIattribute\fP[=\fIvalue\fP]
specify a pre\-authentication attribute and value to be passed to
pre\-authentication plugins.  The acceptable \fIattribute\fP and
\fIvalue\fP values vary from pre\-authentication plugin to plugin.
This option may be specified multiple times to specify multiple
attributes.  If no \fIvalue\fP is specified, it is assumed to be
"yes".
.sp
.nf
The following attributes are recognized by the OpenSSL pkinit
pre-authentication mechanism:
.in +.3i
\fBX509_user_identity\fP=\fIvalue\fP
   specify where to find user's X509 identity information
\fBX509_anchors\fP=\fIvalue\fP
   specify where to find trusted X509 anchor information
\fBflag_RSA_PROTOCOL\fP[=yes]
   specify use of RSA, rather than the default Diffie-Hellman protocol
.in -.3i
.fi
.sp
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B Kinit
uses the following environment variables:
.TP "\w'.SM KRB5CCNAME\ \ 'u"
.SM KRB5CCNAME
Location of the Kerberos 5 credentials (ticket) cache.
.SH FILES
.TP "\w'/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]\ \ 'u"
/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]
default location of Kerberos 5 credentials cache 
([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).
.TP
/etc/krb5.keytab
default location for the local host's
.B keytab
file.
