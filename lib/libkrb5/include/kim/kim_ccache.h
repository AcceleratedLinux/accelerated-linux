 * \page kim_ccache_overview KIM CCache Overview
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_introduction Introduction
 *
 * Kerberos credentials are stored in "ccaches" (short for "credentials caches").
 * The set of all ccaches which the KIM can use is called the "cache collection".   
 * Each ccache has a name and type which uniquely identify it in the cache 
 * collection and a client identity.  The ccache's client identity is the 
 * identity whose credentials are stored in the ccache.  This allows for easy  
 * lookup of all the credentials for a given identity. 
 *
 * KIM attempts to preserve a one-to-one relationship between client identities
 * and ccaches.  If the KIM is used to manipulate the cache collection, there
 * will be one ccache per identity.  However, because low-level APIs allow callers
 * to create multiple ccaches for the same client identity or a single ccache 
 * containing credentials for different client identities, KIM handles those
 * situations.  In general when searching KIM will find the first ccache matching 
 * the requested client identity.  It will not find credentials for the requested  
 * client identity if they are in a ccache with a different client identity.
 *
 * The kim_ccache_t object is a reference to a ccache in the cache collection.  
 * If other applications make changes to the the ccache pointed to by a KIM ccache 
 * object, the object will immediately show those changes.  KIM performs locking 
 * on the cache collection to prevent deadlocks and maintain a consistent behavior 
 * when multiple applications attempt to modify the cache collection.
 *
 * \note KIM ccache APIs are intended for applications and system 
 * tools which manage credentials for the user.  They are not a substitute for
 * krb5 and GSSAPI functions which obtain service credentials for the purpose
 * of authenticating a client to an application server.
 * 
 * \section kim_credential_cache_collection Acquiring a CCache from the Cache Collection
 *
 * KIM provides a simple iterator API for iterating over the ccaches
 * in the cache collection.  First, call #kim_ccache_iterator_create() to obtain 
 * an iterator for the cache collection.  Then loop calling 
 * #kim_ccache_iterator_next() until either you find the ccache you are looking 
 * for or the API returns a NULL ccache, indicating that there are no more
 * ccaches in the cache collection.  When you are done with the iterator, call
 * #kim_ccache_iterator_free().
 *
 * \note #kim_ccache_iterator_next() returns ccache objects which
 * must be freed with #kim_ccache_free() to avoid leaking memory.
 *
 * KIM also provides a convenient API #kim_ccache_create_from_client_identity()
 * which returns the ccache for a specific client identity, if any exists.
 * Typically callers of this API obtain the client identity using
 * #kim_selection_hints_get_identity().
 * 
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_acquire_default Acquiring Credentials from the Default CCache
 *
 * #kim_ccache_create_from_default() returns the default ccache.
 * The default ccache is a legacy concept which was replaced by selection 
 * hints.  Prior to the existence of selection hints, applications always 
 * looked at the default ccache for credentials.  By setting the system default 
 * ccache, users could manually control which credentials each application used.  
 * As the number of ccaches and applications has grown, this mechanism has become
 * unusable.  You should avoid using this API whenever possible.
 *
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_acquire_new Acquiring New Credentials in a CCache
 *
 * KIM provides the #kim_ccache_create_new() API for acquiring new
 * credentials and storing them in a ccache.  Credentials can either be 
 * obtained for a specific client identity or by specifying 
 * #KIM_IDENTITY_ANY to allow the user to choose.  Typically 
 * callers of this API obtain the client identity using 
 * #kim_selection_hints_get_identity().  Depending on the kim_options
 * specified, #kim_ccache_create_new() may present a GUI or command line 
 * prompt to obtain information from the user.
 * 
 * #kim_ccache_create_new_if_needed() 
 * searches the cache collection for a ccache for the client identity
 * and if no appropriate ccache is available, attempts to acquire
 * new credentials and store them in a new ccache.  Depending on the 
 * kim_options specified, #kim_ccache_create_new_if_needed() may 
 * present a GUI or command line prompt to obtain information from the 
 * user. This function exists for convenience and to avoid code duplication.  
 * It can be trivially implemented using 
 * #kim_ccache_create_from_client_identity() and #kim_ccache_create_new().  
 *
 * For legacy password-based Kerberos environments KIM also provides
 * #kim_ccache_create_new_with_password() and 
 * #kim_ccache_create_new_if_needed_with_password().  You should not use these 
 * functions unless you know that they will only be used in environments using 
 * passwords.  Otherwise users without passwords may be prompted for them.
 *
 * KIM provides the #kim_ccache_create_from_keytab() to create credentials 
 * using a keytab and store them in the cache collection. A keytab is an 
 * on-disk copy of a client identity's secret key.  Typically sites use 
 * keytabs for client identities that identify a machine or service and 
 * protect the keytab with disk permissions.  Because a keytab is 
 * sufficient to obtain credentials, keytabs will normally only be readable 
 * by root, Administrator or some other privileged account.  
 * Typically applications use credentials obtained from keytabs to obtain
 * credentials for batch processes.  These keytabs and credentials are usually 
 * for a special identity used for the batch process rather than a user
 * identity.
 *
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_validate Validating Credentials in a CCache
 *
 * A credential with a start time in the future (ie: after the issue date)
 * is called a post-dated credential.  Because the KDC administrator may 
 * wish to disable a identity, once the start time is reached, all post-dated
 * credentials must be validated before they can be used.  Otherwise an
 * attacker using a compromised account could acquire lots of post-dated 
 * credentials to circumvent the acccount being disabled.
 *
 * KIM provides the #kim_ccache_validate() API to validate the TGT  
 * credential in a ccache. Note that this API replaces any existing 
 * credentials with the validated credential.
 * 
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_renew Renewing Credentials in a CCache
 *
 * A renewable credential can be used to obtain a new identical credential
 * without resending secret information (such as a password) to the KDC.
 * A credential may only be renewed during its renewal lifetime and while
 * valid.
 *
 * KIM provides the #kim_ccache_renew() API to renew the TGT credential
 * in a ccache. Note that this API replaces any existing credentials with the 
 * renewed credential.
 *
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_verify Verifying Credentials in a CCache
 *
 * When a program acquires TGT credentials for the purpose of authenticating
 * itself to the machine it is running on, it is insufficient for the machine 
 * to assume that the caller is authorized just because it got credentials.  
 * Instead, the credentials must be verified using a key the local machine.  
 * The reason this is necessary is because an attacker can trick the  
 * machine into obtaining credentials from any KDC, including malicious ones
 * with the same realm name as the local machine's realm.  This exploit is 
 * called the Zanarotti attack.  
 *
 * In order to avoid the Zanarotti attack, the local machine must authenticate
 * the process in the same way an application server would authenticate a client.
 * Like an application server, the local machine must have its own identity in 
 * its realm and a keytab for that identity on its local disk.    However,
 * rather than forcing system daemons to use the network-oriented calls in the 
 * krb5 and GSS APIs, KIM provides the #kim_ccache_verify() API to 
 * verify credentials directly.  
 * 
 * The most common reason for using #kim_ccache_verify() is user login.  
 * If the local machine wants to use Kerberos to verify the username and password
 * provided by the user, it must call #kim_ccache_verify() on the credentials
 * it obtains to make sure they are really from a KDC it trusts.  Another common
 * case is a server which is only using Kerberos internally.  For example an
 * LDAP or web server might use a username and password obtained over the network
 * to get Kerberos credentials.  In order to make sure they aren't being tricked 
 * into talking to the wrong KDC, these servers must also call 
 * #kim_ccache_verify().
 * 
 * The Zanarotti attack is only a concern if the act of accessing the machine 
 * gives the process special access.  Thus a managed cluster machine with 
 * Kerberos-authenticated networked home directories does not need to call 
 * #kim_ccache_verify().  Even though an attacker can log in as any user on   
 * the cluster machine, the attacker can't actually access any of the user's data 
 * or use any of their privileges because those are all authenticated via  
 * Kerberized application servers (and thus require actually having credentials 
 * for the real local realm).
 *
 * #kim_ccache_verify() provides an option to 
 * return success even if the machine's host key is not present.  This option 
 * exists for sites which have a mix of different machines, some of which are  
 * vulnerable to the Zanarotti attack and some are not.  If this option is used, 
 * it is the responsiblity of the machine's maintainer to obtain a keytab
 * for their machine if it needs one.
 *
 *
 * \section kim_ccache_properties Examining CCache Properties
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_type() returns the type of the ccache.  Types include
 * "API" for CCAPI ccaches, "FILE" for file-based ccaches and "MEMORY" for
 * single-process in-memory ccaches.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_name() returns the name of the ccache.  A ccache's name
 * identifies the ccache uniquely among ccaches of the same type.  Note that
 * two ccaches with different types may have the same name.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_display_name() returns a display string which uniquely
 * identifies a ccache.  A ccache display name is of the form "<type>:<name>"
 * and can be displayed to the user or used as an argument to certain krb5
 * APIs, such as krb5_cc_resolve().
 * 
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_client_identity()
 * returns the ccache's client identity.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_valid_credential() 
 * returns the first valid TGT in the ccache for its client identity.  
 * If there are no TGTs in the ccache, it returns the first
 * valid non-TGT credential for the ccache's client identity. 
 * TGT credentials (ie: "ticket-granting tickets") are credentials for  
 * the krbtgt service: a service identity of the form "krbtgt/<REALM>@<REALM>".   
 * These credentials allow the entity named by the client identity to obtain  
 * additional credentials without resending shared secrets (such as a password)
 * to the KDC. Kerberos uses TGTs to provide single sign-on authentication.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_start_time() 
 * returns when the credential's in a ccache will become valid.  
 * Credentials may be "post-dated" which means that their lifetime starts sometime 
 * in the future.  Note that when a post-dated credential's start time is reached, 
 * the credential must be validated.  See \ref kim_credential_validate for more information.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_expiration_time() 
 * returns when the credential's in a ccache will expire. 
 * Credentials are time limited by the lifetime of the credential.  While you can 
 * request a credential of any lifetime, the KDC limits the credential lifetime 
 * to a administrator-defined maximum.  Typically credential lifetime range from 10
 * to 21 hours.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_renewal_expiration_time() 
 * returns when the credential's in a ccache will no longer be renewable. 
 * Valid credentials may be renewed up until their renewal expiration time.  
 * Renewing credentials acquires a fresh set of credentials with a full lifetime 
 * without resending secrets to the KDC (such as a password).  If credentials are 
 * not renewable, this function will return an error.
 *
 * \li #kim_ccache_get_options() 
 * returns a kim_options object with the credential options of the credentials
 * in the ccache.  This function is intended to be used when adding 
 * an identity with existing credentials to the favorite identities list.
 * By passing in the options returned by this call, future requests for the
 * favorite identity will use the same credential options.
 *
 * See \ref kim_ccache_reference and \ref kim_ccache_iterator_reference for 
 * information on specific APIs.
