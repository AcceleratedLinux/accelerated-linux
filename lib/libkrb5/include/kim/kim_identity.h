 * \page kim_identity_overview KIM Identity Overview
 *
 * \section kim_identity_introduction Introduction
 *
 * Identities in Kerberos are named by "principals".  These identies may be people (users)
 * or services (a server running on a host).  When Kerberos issues credentials which
 * authenticate one identity to another, the identity being authenticated is called 
 * the "client identity" and the identity being authenticated to is called the 
 * "service identity".  
 *
 * Kerberos identities are made up of one or more components, as well as the Kerberos realm 
 * the entity belongs to.  For client identities the first component is usually the client 
 * username (eg: "jdoe").  For service identities the first component is the name of the 
 * service (eg: "imap").
 *
 * Kerberos identities have both a binary (opaque) representation and also a string 
 * representation.  The string representation consists of the components separated by '/'
 * followed by an '@' and then the realm.  For example, the identity "jdoe/admin@EXAMPLE.COM"
 * represents John Doe's administrator identity at the realm EXAMPLE.COM.  Note that 
 * identity components may contain both '/' and '@' characters.  When building a
 * identity from its string representation these syntactic characters must be escaped 
 * with '\'. 
 *
 *
 * \section kim_identity_create_display Creating and Displaying Identities
 *
 * KIM Identities can be generated from components, their escaped string representation
 * or from a krb5_principal.  Once you have a KIM identity object, you can also get
 * the component, string or krb5_principal representations back out:
 *
 * \li #kim_identity_create_from_components() creates an identity object from a list of components.  
 * \li #kim_identity_get_number_of_components() returns the number of components in an identity object.
 * \li #kim_identity_get_component_at_index() return a component of an identity object.
 * \li #kim_identity_get_realm() returns the identity's realm.
 *
 * \li #kim_identity_create_from_string() generates an identity object from an escaped string representation.
 * \li #kim_identity_get_string() returns the identity's escaped string representation.
 * \li #kim_identity_get_display_string() returns a non-escaped string for display to the user.
 * This string cannot be passed into #kim_identity_create_from_string().
 *
 * \li #kim_identity_create_from_krb5_principal() generates an identity object from a krb5_principal object.
 * \li #kim_identity_get_krb5_principal() returns a krb5_principal object for an identity object.
 *
 * \note If you need to know if two identity objects refer to the same entity, use #kim_identity_compare().
 *
 *
 * \section kim_identity_selection Choosing a Client Identity
 *
 * Unfortunately most of the time applications don't know what client identity to use.  
 * Users may have identities for multiple Kerberos realms, as well as multiple identities 
 * in a single realm (such as a user and administrator identity).
 *
 * To solve this problem, #kim_selection_hints_get_identity() takes information
 * from the application in the form of a selection hints object and returns the best
 * matching client identity, if one is available.  See \ref kim_selection_hints_overview
 * for more information.
 * 
 *
 * \section kim_identity_password Changing a Identity's Password
 *
 * Many Kerberos sites use passwords for user accounts.  Because passwords may be
 * stolen or compromised, they must be frequently changed.  KIM provides APIs to
 * change the identity's password directly, and also handles changing the identity's
 * password when it has expired.
 *
 * #kim_identity_change_password() presents a user interface to obtain the old and 
 * new passwords from the user.   
 *
 * \note Not all identities have a password. Some sites use certificates (pkinit) 
 * and in the future there may be other authentication mechanisms (eg: smart cards).
 * 
 * See \ref kim_identity_reference for information on specific APIs.
