.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I kpropd 
command runs on the slave KDC server.  It listens for update requests
made by the
.IR kprop (8)
program, and periodically requests incremental updates from the
master KDC.

When the slave receives a kprop request from the master,
.I kpropd 
accepts the dumped KDC database and places it in a file, and then runs 
.IR kdb5_util (8)
to load the dumped database into the active database which is used by 
.IR krb5kdc (8).
Thus, the master Kerberos server can use 
.IR kprop (8)
to propagate its database to the slave slavers.  Upon a successful download 
of the KDC database file, the slave Kerberos server will have an
up-to-date KDC database. 
.PP
Normally, kpropd is invoked out of 
.I inetd(8).  
This is done by adding a line to the inetd.conf file which looks like
this:

kprop	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/kpropd	kpropd

However, kpropd can also run as a standalone deamon, if the
.B \-S
option is turned on.  This is done for debugging purposes, or if for
some reason the system administrator just doesn't want to run it out of
.IR inetd (8).

When the slave periodically requests incremental updates,
.I kpropd
updates its
.I principal.ulog
file with any updates from the master.
.IR kproplog (8)
can be used to view a summary of the update entry log on the slave
KDC.  Incremental propagation is not enabled by default; it can be
enabled using the
.I iprop_enable
and
.I iprop_slave_poll
settings in
.IR kdc.conf (5).
The principal "kiprop/slavehostname@REALM" (where "slavehostname" is
the name of the slave KDC host, and "REALM" is the name of the
Kerberos realm) must be present in the slave's keytab file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrealm\fP
specifies the realm of the master server; by default the realm returned
by
.IR krb5_default_local_realm (3)
is used.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP \fIfile\fP
specifies the filename where the dumped principal database file is to be
stored; by default the dumped database file is KPROPD_DEFAULT_FILE
(normally /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/from_master).
.TP
.B \-p
allows the user to specify the pathname to the
.IR kdb5_util (8)
program; by default the pathname used is KPROPD_DEFAULT_KDB5_UTIL
(normally /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util).
.TP
.B \-S
turn on standalone mode.  Normally, kpropd is invoked out of
.IR inetd (8)
so it expects a network connection to be passed to it from
.I inetd (8).
If the 
.B \-S 
option is specified, kpropd will put itself into the background, and
wait for connections to the KPROP_SERVICE port (normally krb5_prop).
.TP
.B \-d
turn on debug mode.  In this mode, if the
.B \-S 
option is selected, 
.I kpropd
will not detach itself from the current job and run in the background.
Instead, it will run in the foreground and print out debugging messages
during the database propagation.
.TP
.B \-P
allow for an alternate port number for
.I kpropd
to listen on. This is only useful if the program is run in standalone
mode.
.TP
.B \-a
allows the user to specify the path to the
kpropd.acl
file; by default the path used is KPROPD_ACL_FILE
(normally /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl).
.SH FILES
.TP "\w'kpropd.acl\ \ 'u"
kpropd.acl
Access file for
.BR kpropd ;
the default location is KPROPD_ACL_FILE (normally
/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl).
Each entry is a line containing the principal of a host from which the
local machine will allow Kerberos database propagation via kprop.
