 * This file contains tests for the PRF code in Kerberos.  IT reads an
 * input file, and writes an output file.  It is assumed that the
 * output file will be diffed against expected output to see whether
 * regression tests pass.  The input file is a very primitive format.
 * It includes an enctype and password to be string2keyed followed by
 * a number of bytes of input length, followed by that many bytes of
 * input.  The program outputs krb5_c_prf of that input and key as a
 * hex string.
