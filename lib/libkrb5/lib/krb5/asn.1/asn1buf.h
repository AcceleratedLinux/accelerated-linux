  Overview

    The coding buffer is an array of char (to match a krb5_data structure)
     with 3 reference pointers:
     1) base - The bottom of the octet array.  Used for memory management
               operations on the array (e.g. alloc, realloc, free).
     2) next - Points to the next available octet position in the array.
               During encoding, this is the next free position, and it
                 advances as octets are added to the array.
               During decoding, this is the next unread position, and it
                 advances as octets are read from the array.
     3) bound - Points to the top of the array. Used for bounds-checking.

    All pointers to encoding buffers should be initalized to NULL.
