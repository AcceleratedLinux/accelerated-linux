/*
 Similar to krb5_get_in_tkt_with_password.

 Attempts to get an initial ticket for creds->client to use server
 creds->server, (realm is taken from creds->client), with options
 options, and using creds->times.starttime, creds->times.endtime,
 creds->times.renew_till as from, till, and rtime.  
 creds->times.renew_till is ignored unless the RENEWABLE option is requested.

 If addrs is non-NULL, it is used for the addresses requested.  If it is
 null, the system standard addresses are used.

 If keyblock is NULL, an appropriate key for creds->client is retrieved
 from the system key store (e.g. /etc/srvtab).  If keyblock is non-NULL,
 it is used as the decryption key.

 A succesful call will place the ticket in the credentials cache ccache.

 returns system errors, encryption errors
