The deja-gnu unit tests in this directory are arranged as follows:

api.0: original unit tests for the ovsec_kadm_api

api.1: additional tests for ovsec_kadm_api that run after api.0

api.2: Each file whose name is the same as a file in api.0 contains
all of the same tests, but using the kadm5 with KADM5_API_VERSION_1.
Each file with a -v2 suffix tests KADM5_API_VERSION_2-specific
functionality.  New tests should be added to the files in this
directory, not api.0.  Tests should be added to the lowest-numbered
version file they apply to.
