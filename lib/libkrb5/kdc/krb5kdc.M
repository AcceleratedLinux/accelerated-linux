.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb5kdc
is the Kerberos version 5 Authentication Service and Key Distribution
Center (AS/KDC).
.PP
The
.B \-x
.I db_args
option specifies the database specific arguments.

Options supported for LDAP database are:
.sp 
.nf 
.RS 8
\-x nconns=<number_of_connections>
.fi
specifies the number of connections to be maintained per LDAP server.

.nf
\-x host=<ldapuri>
specifies the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI.

\-x binddn=<binddn>
.fi
specifies the DN of the object used by the KDC server to bind to the LDAP server.
This object should have the rights to read the realm container, principal container
and the subtree that is referenced by the realm.

\-x bindpwd=<bind_password>
.fi
specifies the password for the above mentioned binddn. It is recommended not to use this option.
Instead, the password can be stashed using the stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util.
.RE
.fi
.PP
The
.B \-r
.I realm
option specifies the realm for which the server should provide service;
by default the realm returned by
.IR krb5_default_local_realm (3)
is used.
.PP
The
.B \-d
.I dbname
option specifies the name under which the principal database can be found; by
default the database is in DEFAULT_DBM_FILE.
This option does not apply to the LDAP database.
.PP
The
.B \-k
.I keytype
option specifies the key type of the master key to be entered manually
as a password when -m is given; the default is "des-cbc-crc".
.PP
The
.B \-M
.I mkeyname
option specifies the principal name for the master key in the database;
the default is KRB5_KDB_M_NAME (usually "K/M" in the KDC's realm).
.PP
The
.B \-p
.I portnum
option specifies the default UDP port number which the KDC should listen on for
Kerberos version 5 requests.  This value is used when no port is specified in
the KDC profile and when no port is specified in the Kerberos configuration
file.
If no value is available, then the value in /etc/services for service
"kerberos" is used.
.PP
The
.B \-m
option specifies that the master database password should be fetched
from the keyboard rather than from a file on disk.
.PP
The
.B \-n
option specifies that the KDC does not put itself in the background
and does not disassociate itself from the terminal.  In normal
operation, you should always allow the KDC to place itself in
the background.
.PP
The KDC may service requests for multiple realms (maximum 32 realms).  The
realms are listed on the command line.  Per-realm options that can be
specified on the command line pertain for each realm that follows it and are
superceded by subsequent definitions of the same option.  For example, 
.PP
.B krb5kdc
.B \-p
.I 2001
.B \-r
.I REALM1
.B \-p
.I 2002
.B \-r
.I REALM2
.B \-r
.I REALM3
.PP
specifies that the KDC listen on port 2001 for REALM1 and on port 2002 for
REALM2 and REALM3.  Additionally, per-realm parameters may be specified in the
.I kdc.conf
file.  The location of this file may be specified by the
.I KRB5_KDC_PROFILE
environment variable.  Parameters specified in this file take precedence over
options specified on the command line.  See the
.I kdc.conf(5)
description for further details.

.SH BUGS

It should fork and go into the background when it finishes reading the
master password from the terminal.
