<h1>Network Identity Manager - Destroy Credentials</h1>

<p>This action will attempt to destroy the credentials that are
currently selected in the credentials window.
</p>

<p>In some cases, you may need to select all the credentials of a
specific type for the delete operation to succeed.  This happens when
the credentials provider does not support deleting individual
credentials, but supports deleting all the credentials stored in one
specific location.
</p>

<p>The action can be invoked by selecting the credentials and then
pressing the <span class="pre">Delete</span> key or by pressing <span
class="pre">Ctrl + D</span>.  You can also select the <span
class="pre">Delete credentials</span> action from the context menu
(available via right-clicking inside the credentials window) or the
credentials menu.
