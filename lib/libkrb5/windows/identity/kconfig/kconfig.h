    If the configuration space does not exist and the \a flags specify

    flags.  If the \a flags only specifies ::KCONF_FLAG_MACHINE, then

    flags specifies any combination of stores including \a
    ::KCONF_FLAG_USER, then the configuration space is created in the
    user store.  Note that ::KCONF_FLAG_SCHEMA is readonly.

    Once opened, use khc_close_space() to close the configuration
    space.

    \param[in] parent The parent configuration space.  The path
        specified in \a cspace is relative to the parent.  Set this to
        NULL to indicate the root configuration space.  

    \param[in] cspace The configuration path.  This can be up to

        specify hiearchy.  Set this to NULL to reopen the parent
        configuration space.

    \param[in] flags Flags.  This can be a combination of KCONF_FLAG_*
        constants and KHM_FLAG_CREATE.  If none of ::KCONF_FLAG_USER,
        ::KCONF_FLAG_MACHINE or ::KCONF_FLAG_SCHEMA is specified, then
        it defaults to all three.

    \param[out] result Pointer to a handle which receives the handle
        to the opened configuration space if the call succeeds.

    \note You can re-open a configuration space with different flags
