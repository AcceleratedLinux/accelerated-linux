/*! \defgroup kherr NetIDMgr Error Reporting

    Error reporting functions provide a mechanism to construct
    meaningful and user friendly error reports for the user.

    Unlike most of the other NetIDMgr API's, the error reporting APIs
    are lightweight and usually do not return an error value.  This is
    mostly because, these functions are called \b after an error
    occurs.

    An application can register an event handler that gets notified of
    events that pertain to error contexts.  More than one handler can
    be registered.  The order in which the handlers are called is
    undefined for any specific event.

    These event occur in the context of individual application
    threads.  The handler will be called from within the thread that
    caused the event.  Therefore it is important that the handler is
    both reentrant and returns quickly.

    The events that the handler will be notified of are explained

    <b>KHERR_CTX_BEGIN</b>: Notification that a new context was
    created.  A pointer to the context will be supplied to the
    handler.  The supplied pointer should not be used to obtain a hold
    on the context, as it will prevent the context from being closed.

    <b>KHERR_CTX_DESCRIBE</b>: The thread called
    kherr_set_desc_event() to set the description of a context.  Once
    again, the pointer should not be used to obtain a hold on the
    context.

    <b>KHERR_CTX_ERROR</b>: The last event that was reported for the
    context was an error event (the severity was was equal or higher
    than KHERR_ERROR).  The pointer may be used to obtain a hold on
    the context.  However, it is the application's resonsibility to
    make sure that the hold is released later.  Otherwise the event
    will never be closed.

    <b>KHERR_CTX_END</b>: Closure.  This event is signalled when the
    last open handle to the context is closed and there is no thread
    that is currently active which has this context in its error
    context stack.  At the time the handler is invoked, the context is
    still intact.  The pointer that is supplied should not be used to
    obtain a handle on the context.

    <b>KHERR_CTX_EVTCOMMIT</b>: An event was committed into the error
    context.  An event is committed when another event is reported
    after the event, or if the context is closed.  Since the last
    event that is reported can still be modified by adding new
    information, the event remains open until it is no longer the last
    event or the context is no longer active.  When this notification
    is received, the last event in the context's event queue is the
    event that was committed.

    \param[in] h Context event handler, of type ::kherr_ctx_handler

    \param[in] filter A combination of ::kherr_ctx_event values
        indication which notifications should be sent to the handler.
        If a \a filter value of zero is provided, all of the events
        will be sent to the handler.

        should be tracked.  If this is zero, all error contexts can
        trigger the handler.

/*! \brief Report an error

    Creates an event, fills in the details specified in the arguments,
    and adds it to the current error context.

    If the current thread does not have an error context, no reporting
    happens.  However, if any of the supplied strings or parameters
    are marked as allocated, they will be freed before the function
    returns.

    Certain parameters that expect strings can instead be given string
    resources, message resources or allocated strings in addition to
    constant string.  By default, the parameters are expected to be
    constant strings.

    <b>Allocated strings</b>: The application can allocate memory for
    a string.  Since the application is not notified when the event is
    no longer used and freed, it \b must indicate that the string is
    an allocated string by setting the appropriate flag in the \a
    flags parameter.  When the event is no longer used, the memory
    pointed to by the relevant pointer will be freed through a call to
    free().  Not all string parameters take allocated strings.  See
    individual parameter documentation for details.

    <b>String resources</b>: On WIN32, string resources can be passed
    in to kherr_report() using the MAKEINTRESOURCE macro.  However,
    the application \b must specify that the parameter is a string
    resource using the appropriate flag in the \a flags parameter.
    The error reporting engine will expand the string against the
    module handle passed in the \a h_module parameter when the value
    of the string is required.  Not all string parameters take string
    resources.  See individual parameter documentation for details.
    Strings loaded through string resources cannot be longer than
    ::KHERR_MAXCCH_STRING in characters inclusive of terminating NULL.

    <b>Message resources</b>: On WIN32, message resources can be
    passed in to kherr_report() by specifying the message ID where it
    ordinarily expects a pointer to a constant string.  The
    application \b must indicate that the string is a message resource
    by using the appropriate flag in the \a flags parameter.  When the
    value of the string is needed, it is expanded against the module
    handle passed in the \a h_module parameter using the message ID.
    Not all string parameters take message resources.  See individual
    parameter documentation for details.  Note that the facility and
    severity values associated with a message resource are ignored.
    Strings loaded through message resources cannot be longer than
    ::KHERR_MAXCCH_STRING in characters inclusive of terminating NULL.

    <b>Formatted fields</b>: Parameters that are formatted can have
    can have parameter inserts like in printf(). However, specifying
    inserts is different from printf() and follows the conventions
    used in WIN32 API FormatMessage().  This is because for localized
    strings, the order of the parameters in the string may be
    different.  See the documentation for FormatMessage() for details
    on the format string.  The same set of parameters (i.e. \a p1, \a
    p2, \a p3, \a p4) is used for all formatted strings with
    appropriate marshalling for 64 bit types.  The size of the string
    after expansion must not exceed 65536 bytes inclusive of
    terminating NULL.

    \param[in] severity One of ::kherr_severity_level
    \param[in] short_desc Short description or title (localized).  Can
        be a string resource, message resource, allocated string or
        constant string.  The \a flags parameter should indicate the
        type of string used.
    \param[in] facility Facility name of the reporter (not localized)
    \param[in] location Usually the function name or such of where the
        event occured (not localized)
    \param[in] long_desc Long description of event (localized,
        formatted). Can be a string resource, message resource,
        allocated string or constant string.  The \a flags parameter
        should indicate the type of string used.
    \param[in] suggestion Suggested action to correct situation, if
        applicable (localized). Can be a string resource, message
        resource, allocated string or constant string.  The \a flags
        parameter should indicate the type of string used.
    \param[in] facility_id Identifier of facility.  Application
        defined.
    \param[in] suggestion_id One of the suggestion identifiers from
        ::kherr_suggestion_ids
    \param[in] p1 First parameter. Used for formatting.
    \param[in] p2 Second parameter. Used for formatting.
    \param[in] p3 Third parameter. Used for formatting.
    \param[in] p4 Fourth parameter. Used for formatting.
    \param[in] flags Flags.  See ::kherr_report_flags
    \param[in] h_module Handle to a module that resolves any string or
        message resources used for the \a short_description , \a
        long_desc or \a suggestion parameters.  This parameter is only
        available on WIN32.

    \note With the exception of parameters of type KEPT_STRINGT and
        parameters which are flagged for freeing using the \a flags
        parameter, all other string parameters are assumed to be
        pointers to constant strings.  The strings are not copied and
        the pointers are used as is.  Also, no clean-up is performed
        when the event is freed other than that implied by \a flags.

    progress value returned by this function is as follows:

    If one or more of the following conditions are true, then the
    returned progress values are the values set for the context using
    the most recent call to kherr_set_progress():

    - if the numerator and the denominator are non-zero

    - if the ::KHERR_CF_OWN_PROGRESS flag is set for the context.

    Otherwise, the function will calculate the progress by enumerating
    all the child context for the context and summing up the
    normalized numerators and the denominators for them.
