    The \a modulename parameter specifies a module to load.  Depending

    until the module and the associated plugins are all initialized,
    or an error occurs.

    If the KMM_LM_FLAG_NOLOAD flag is set, then a handle to an
    existing instance of the module will be returned.  If the module
    hasn't been loaded yet, then no handle is returned and the
    function returns KHM_ERROR_NOT_FOUND.
