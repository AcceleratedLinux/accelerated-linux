/** \brief Collect credentials from a credential set to another credential set.

    Collecting a subset of credentials from credential set \a cs_src
    into credential set \a cs_dest involves the following steps:

    - Select all credentials from \a cs_src that matches the \a
      identity and \a type specified in the function call and add them
      to the \a cs_dest credential set if they are not there already.
      Note that if neither credential set is not the root credential
      store, then the credentials will be added by reference, while if
      it is the root credential store, the credentials will be
      duplicated, and the copies will be added to \a cs_dest.

    - If a selected credential in \a cs_src already exists in \a
      cs_dest, then update the credential in \a cs_dest with the
      credential fields in \a cs_src.  In other words, once a
      credential is found to exist in both \a cs_src and \a cs_dest,
      all the non-null fields from the credential in \a cs_src will be
      copied to the credential in \a cs_dest.  Fields which are null
      (undefined) in \a cs_src and are non-null in \a cs_dest will be
      left unmodified in \a cs_dest.

      One notable exception is the credentials' flags.  All flags in
      \a cs_src which are not included in
      ::KCDB_CRED_FLAGMASK_ADDITIVE will be copied to the
      corresponding bits in the flags of \a cs_dest.  However, flags
      that are included in ::KCDB_CRED_FLAGMASK_ADDITIVE will be added
      to the corresponding bits in \a cs_dest.

      (See notes below)

    - Remove all credentials from \a cs_dest that match the \a
      identity and \a type that do not appear in \a cs_src. (see notes
      below)

    For performance reasons, plugins should use kcdb_credset_collect()
    to update the root credentials store instead of adding and
    removing individual credentials from the root store.

    Only credentials that are associated with active identities are
    affected by kcdb_credset_collect().

    \param[in] cs_dest A handle to the destination credential set.  If
        this is \a NULL, then it is assumed to refer to the root
        credential store.

    \param[in] cs_src A handle to the source credential set.  If this
        is NULL, then it is assumed to refer to the root credential
        store.

    \param[in] identity A handle to an identity.  Setting this to NULL
        collects all identities in the credential set.

    \param[in] type A credentials type.  Setting this to
        KCDB_CREDTYPE_ALL collects all credential types in the set.

    \param[out] delta A bit mask that indicates the modifications that
        were made to \a cs_dest as a result of the collect operation.
        This is a combination of KCDB_DELTA_* values.  This parameter
        can be \a NULL if the value is not required.

    \warning If \a identity and \a type is set to a wildcard, all
        credentials in the root store that are not in this credentials
        set will be deleted.

    \note Two credentials \a A and \a B are considered equal if:
        - They refer to the same identity
        - Both have the same credential type
        - Both have the same name
