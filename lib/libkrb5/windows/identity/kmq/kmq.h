/*! \brief Subscribe a window to a message type

    Adds the window specified by \a hwnd to the subscription list for
    the message type \a type.  When a message of this type is posted,
    then the window procedure of the window \a hwnd receives a message
    ::KMQ_WM_DISPATCH.

    When a window receives a ::KMQ_WM_DISPATCH message, it means that
    a message has been posted which is of a type that the window has
    subscribed for.  Because of the way Windows handles window
    messages and the way NetIDMgr message queues work, a thread which
    has a window (or thread) procedure can not call kmq_dispatch() to
    handle these messages.  For threads that have window or thread
    message loops, they must call kmq_subscribe_hwnd() to subscribe a
    particular window (for thread message loops, this would be the
    HWND of the message window for the thread) to NetIDMgr messages.

    There are two supported ways of handling the ::KMQ_WM_DISPATCH
    message.  Examples of both are provided below.

    Handling the message inline:

    \code
    LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
    kmq_message * m;
    khm_int32 rv;
    ...
    switch(uMsg) {
    case WM_CREATE:
       ...
       kmq_subscribe_hwnd(KMSG_CRED, hwnd);
       ...
       break;

    case WM_DESTROY:
       ...
       kmq_unsubscribe_hwnd(KMSG_CRED, hwnd);
       ...
       break;

    ...
    case KMQ_WM_DISPATCH:
        kmq_wm_begin(lParam,&m);

	if(m->type == KMSG_CRED && m->subtype == KMSG_CRED_ROOTDELTA) {
	// do something
        rv = KHM_ERROR_SUCCESS;
	}

	return kmq_wm_end(m, rv);
    ...
    };
    ...
    }
    \endcode

    The other method is to dispatch the ::KMQ_WM_DISPATCH message to a
    secondary callback function:

    \code
    khm_int32 msg_handler(khm_int32 t, khm_int32 st, khm_ui_4 up, void * pb) {
        khm_int32 rv = KHM_ERROR_SUCCESS;

        //handle message

	return rv;
    }

    LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
    kmq_message * m;
    khm_int32 rv;
    ...
    switch(uMsg) {
    ...

    case WM_CREATE:
       ...
       kmq_subscribe_hwnd(KMSG_CRED, hwnd);
       ...
       break;

    case WM_DESTROY:
       ...
       kmq_unsubscribe_hwnd(KMSG_CRED, hwnd);
       ...
       break;

    ...
    case KMQ_WM_DISPATCH:
        return kmq_wm_dispatch(lParam, msg_handler);
    ...
    };
    ...
    }
    \endcode

    \note Make sure you unsubscribe from the message type when the
        window is destroyed.

/*! \brief Abort a call

    Abort a pending call.  The call handle should have been obtained
    using a prior call to kmq_post_message_ex().

    Note that this function may not abort the call immediately.  It
    merely marks the message as being in an aborted state.  It is upto
    the individual handlers of the message to check if the message has
    been aborted and act accordingly.

    The handlers are expected to call kmq_is_call_aborted()
    periodicially during the processing of specially lengthy
    operations during the course of handling a message. That function
    will return \a TRUE if the last dispatched message is now in an
    aborted state.  In which case, the handler is expected to abort
    handling the message and return control to the dispatcher.

/*! \brief Check if the last dispatched message was aborted

    The sender of a message may abort it using a call to
    kmq_abort_call().  This function checks if the last dispatched
    message was aborted.

    A handler of a message is expected to call this function
    periodically if handling the message is going to take a specially
    long time (e.g. more than 5 or 10 seconds).  If the message is
    found to be aborted, the handler is expected to abort handling the
    message, perform any necessary cleanup and return control to the
    dispatcher.

    Doing this allows operations like new credentials acquisition to
    be cleanly aborted by the user if she so wishes.  Otherwise,
    Network Identity Manager has to wait for the message to complete
    processing since it has no means of cleanly terminating an
    executing plug-in thread.
