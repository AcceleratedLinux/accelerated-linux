    "libpwrite"
    A C library for portable packet creation.

    Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of network
    packets.  It provides a portable framework for low-level network
    packet writing and handling (use libnet in conjunction with libpcap and
    you can write some really cool stuff).  Libnet includes packet creation
    at the IP layer and at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary
    and complementary functionality.  Libnet is very handy with which to
    write network tools and network test code.  See the manpage and sample
    test code for more detailed information.
