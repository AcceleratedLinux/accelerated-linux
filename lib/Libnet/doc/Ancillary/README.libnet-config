    As of version .99c, libnet gcc options should be handled via the
    libnet-config script.  This script, created during the GNU configure
    process will ensure that future libnet compilations contain the correct
    CPP and CFLAG options as well as libraries for the targeted architecture.
    A sample invocation might be:

host:~> gcc -Wall `libnet-config --defines` foo.c `libnet-config --libs`

    As of version 0.99e, it is mandatory that it be invoked, if for no
    other reason than to specify byte-ordering.  See README.legacy-applications
    for more information.
