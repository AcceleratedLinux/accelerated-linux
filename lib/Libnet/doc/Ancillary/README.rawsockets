    Raw sockets are horribly non-standard across implementations.  Solaris,
    for example, has terrible support for this packet interface.  Older OpenBSD
    versions and recent FreeBSD versions have the BSD_BYTE_SWAP issue where
    the ip_len and ip_frag fields need to be in little endian order.  Linux
    apparently doesn't allow for the injection of broadcast IP datagrams.
    Whenever complete control over the IP header is desired, use the link
    layer API.
