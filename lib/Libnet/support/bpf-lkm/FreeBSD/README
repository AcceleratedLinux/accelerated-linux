    etherspoof lkm module
    FreeBSD 3.0

    Etherspoof is an lkm module that allows a bpf device to specify (forge)
    arbitrary ethernet MAC addresses.  FreeBSD 3.0-19980804-SNAP port by
    route; originally written by Thomas Ptacek.  His original readme
    contents follow.

    The 4.4BSD machine-independant ethernet driver does not allow upper layers
    to forge the ethernet source address; all ethernet outputs cause the
    output routine to build a new ethernet header, and the process that does
    this explicitly copies the MAC address registered to the interface into
    this header.

    This is odd, because the bpf writing convention asserts that writes to bpf
    must include a link-level header; it's intuitive to assume that this
    header is, along with the rest of the packet data, written to the wire.

    This is not the case, though. The link-layer header is used solely by the
    bpf code, in order to build a sockaddr structure that is passed to the
    generic ethernet output routine; the header is then effectively stripped
    off the packet. The ethernet output routine consults this sockaddr to
    obtain the ethernet type and destination address, but not the source
    address.

    This code is a slightly modified version of FreeBSD 3.0's original
    ethernet output routine. The sole difference is that this output routine
    retrieves the source ethernet address from the sockaddr, and uses it as
    the source address for the header written the wire. This allows bpf to be
    used to seamlessly forge ethernet packets in their entirety, which has
    applications in address management. 

    The modload glue provided traverses the global list of system interfaces,
    and replaces any pointer to the original ethernet output routine with the
    new one we've provided. The unload glue undoes this. The effect of
    loading this module will be that all ethernet interfaces on the system
    will support source address forging.
