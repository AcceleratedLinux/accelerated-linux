    This directory contains useful utility code snippets.  These are intended
    to be either stand-alone programs, or do something useful other than just
    proving the library works (the testcode takes care of that).

    Get-mac/get_mac.c   -   contains a simple routine to get the MAC address of
                            a remote host given its IP address.  This is 
                            crucial to applications that need to write link
                            layer packets to hosts for which they don't
                            have the MAC.  This technique can be used to hide
                            the link layer interface from the programmer and
                            abstract it further.  At this point, however,
                            the code only works for hosts on the local network
                            and does not timeout and resend packets.
