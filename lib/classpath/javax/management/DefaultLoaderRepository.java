 * Maintains a list of the {@link ClassLoader} instances

 * to be used to load classes.  In early versions of the
 * JMX API, this class represented a shared repository for
 * the classloaders of all management servers.  The management
 * of classloaders is now decentralised and this class is
 * deprecated.  The old behaviour is emulated by consulting
 * the {@link MBeanServer#getClassLoaderRepository()} method
 * of all the servers obtained from
 * {@link MBeanServerFactory#findMBeanServer(String)}.  Use of
 * this class should be avoided in new code.
 *
