   * conversion is necessary.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The two methods, {@code getStatistics} and {@code setStatistics}
   * similarly define another attribute, {@code Statistics}.  Calling
   * {@code getStatistics()} will cause a call to the server to be
   * made as before, {@code server.getAttribute(name, "Statistics")}.
   * However, the type of the return value from this call will be
   * an array of {@link Double} objects, as per the {@link MXBean}
   * rules.  The proxy converts this back in to a {@link java.util.List}
   * of {@link Double} objects before returning it.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The same process is applied in reverse for
   * {@code setStatistics(newStats)}.  The list is converted into
   * an appropriate array before the call to
   * {@link MBeanServerConnection#setAttribute(ObjectName, Attribute)}
   * is made.  Finally, a call to {@code getNamedStatistics} will require
   * both a Java to open type conversion on the arguments, and then
   * an open type to Java conversion of the return value.  Thus, a proxy
   * enables an {@link MXBean} to be used in cases where the appropriate
   * Java types are available and the user wishes to access the bean
   * using the types directly defined in its interface, just as with
   * standard management beans.
