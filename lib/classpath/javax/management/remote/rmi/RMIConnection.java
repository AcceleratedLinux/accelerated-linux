/**
 * <p>
 * RMI interface for forwarding requests to a remote
 * {@link javax.management.MBeanServer}.  This interface
 * parallels the {@link javax.management.MBeanServerConnection}
 * interface, providing a way of invoking those methods using
 * the RMI protocol.  When a client wishes to call a method
 * of an MBean server using RMI, the method is called on the stub
 * on the client side, which serializes the object parameters
 * and sends them to the server where they are deserialized and
 * an implementation of this interface forwards them to the
 * appropriate MBean server.  Return values follow the same
 * process, only in reverse.  Each client obtains its own
 * implementation of this interface from an {@link RMIServer}
 * instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface do more than simply
 * forward requests directly to the server.  The arguments
 * of the server methods are wrapped in {@link MarshalledObject}
 * instances, so that the correct classloader can be used to
 * deserialize the arguments.  When a method is called, the
 * implementation must first retrieve the appropriate classloader
 * and then use it to deserialize the marshalled object.  Unless
 * explicitly specified in the documentation for the method,
 * a parameter of the type {@link MarshalledObject} or an array
 * of that type should not be {@code null}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Security is also handled by this interface, as the methods
 * use an additional {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} parameter
 * for role delegation.
 * </p>
