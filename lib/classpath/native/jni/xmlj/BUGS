GNU Jaxp
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These bugs are for the gnu.xml.libxmlj package.

CAVEAT: LibxmlJ's current incarnation is incomplete and partly
incorrect. Highly experimental.

- Thread-safe, but effectively runs single-threaded.

- Native code passes incorrect URIs to URIResolver.resolve.

- Default output properties accessible through JAXP always assume XML
  output (in violation of the XSLT 1.0 specification, section 16)
  Correction: LibxmlJ always assumes XML output.

- OutputProperties are not properly implemented, compare code and API
  documentation.

- TransformerFactory.getAttribute() and
  TransformerFactory.setAttribute() not implemented, i.e. low-level
  libxslt settings can currently not be accessed from Java.

- TransformerFactory.getFeature() not implemented, i.e. currently no
  low-level features of libxslt are advertised.

FIXME:

- Make LRU caching configurable.

- Check whether <?xml encoding="..."?> headers are honored.

- DefaultURIResolver uses naive approach.

- TransformerFactory.getAssociatedStyleSheet() unfinished.
