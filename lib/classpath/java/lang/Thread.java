/**
 * Thread represents a single thread of execution in the VM. When an
 * application VM starts up, it creates a non-daemon Thread which calls the
 * main() method of a particular class.  There may be other Threads running,
 * such as the garbage collection thread.
 *
 * <p>Threads have names to identify them.  These names are not necessarily
 * unique. Every Thread has a priority, as well, which tells the VM which
 * Threads should get more running time. New threads inherit the priority
 * and daemon status of the parent thread, by default.
 *
 * <p>There are two methods of creating a Thread: you may subclass Thread and
 * implement the <code>run()</code> method, at which point you may start the
 * Thread by calling its <code>start()</code> method, or you may implement
 * <code>Runnable</code> in the class you want to use and then call new
 * <code>Thread(your_obj).start()</code>.
 *
 * <p>The virtual machine runs until all non-daemon threads have died (either
 * by returning from the run() method as invoked by start(), or by throwing
 * an uncaught exception); or until <code>System.exit</code> is called with
 * adequate permissions.
 *
 * <p>It is unclear at what point a Thread should be added to a ThreadGroup,
 * and at what point it should be removed. Should it be inserted when it
 * starts, or when it is created?  Should it be removed when it is suspended
 * or interrupted?  The only thing that is clear is that the Thread should be
 * removed when it is stopped.
