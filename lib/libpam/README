Hello!

Thanks for downloading Linux-PAM.

NOTES:

How to use it is as follows:

      ./configure --help | less
      ./configure <your-options>
      make

Note, if you are worried - don't even think about doing the next line
(most Linux distributions already support PAM out of the box, so if
something goes wrong with installing the code from this version your
box may stop working..)

      make install

That said, please report problems to the bug reporting database
on sourceforge.net.
