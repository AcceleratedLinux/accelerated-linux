This is a help file for the pam_time module. It explains the need for
pam_time and also the syntax of the /etc/security/time.conf file.
[a lot of the syntax is freely adapted from the porttime file of the
shadow suite.]

1. Introduction
===============

It is desirable to restrict access to a system and or specific
applications at various times of the day and on specific days or over
various terminal lines.

The pam_time module is intended to offer a configurable module that
satisfies this purpose, within the context of Linux-PAM.

2. the /etc/security/time.conf file
===================================

This file is the configuration script for defining time/port access
control to the system/applications.

Its syntax is described in the sample ./time.conf provided in this
directory.

unrecognised rules are ignored (but an error is logged to syslog(3))
