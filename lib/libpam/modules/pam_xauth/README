pam_xauth:
	Forward xauth cookies from user to user, normally used by su, sudo, or
	userhelper.

	Primitive access control is provided by ~/.xauth/export in the invoking
	user's home directory and ~/.xauth/import in the target user's home
	directory.

	If a user has a ~/.xauth/import file, the user will only receive cookies
	from users listed in the file.  If there is no ~/.xauth/import file,
	the user will accept cookies from any other user.

	If a user has a .xauth/export file, the user will only forward cookies
	to users listed in the file.  If there is no ~/.xauth/export file, and
	the invoking user is not "root", the user will forward cookies to
	any other user.  If there is no ~/.xauth/export file, and the invoking
	user is "root", the user will NOT forward cookies to other users.

	Both the import and export files support wildcards (such as "*").  Both
	the import and export files can be empty, signifying that no users are
	allowed.
