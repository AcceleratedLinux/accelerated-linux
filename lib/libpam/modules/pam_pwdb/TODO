	* verify that it works for everyone
	* look more seriously at the issue of generating a shadow
	  system on the fly
	* add some more password flavors

	* check that complete rewrite works! ;^)
	* complete shadow support to the password changing code.
	  Also some code needed here for session managment?
	  (both pam.conf argument to turn it on/off, and some
	  conditional compilation.)
	* md5 passwords...
	* make the exclusive nature of the arguments work. That is,
	  only recognize the flags when appropriate.

	* support.c should go.

	* pam_sm_chauth_tok() should be written
	* QUICK FIX: pam_sm_setcred() probably returns incorrect error code
