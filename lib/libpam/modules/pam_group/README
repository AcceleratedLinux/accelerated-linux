This is a help file for the pam_group module. It explains the need for
pam_group and also the syntax of the /etc/security/group.conf file.

1. Introduction
===============

It is desirable to give extra privileges to a user running a specific
PAM aware application at various times of the day and on specific days
or over various terminal lines by adding this user to extra groups.

The pam_group module is intended to offer a configurable module that
satisfies this purpose, within the context of Linux-PAM.

2. the /etc/security/group.conf file
===================================

Its syntax is described in the sample group.conf file.

unrecognised rules are ignored (but an error is logged to syslog(3))
