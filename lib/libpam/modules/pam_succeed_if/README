pam_succeed_if:
	Succeed or fail based on account characteristics.

	pam_succeed_if.so is designed to succeed or fail authentication based
	on characteristics of the account belonging to the user being
	authenticated.

	The module can be given one or more conditions as module arguments, and
	authentication will succeed only if all of the conditions are met.

	Conditions are expressed in the form

		ATTRIBUTE OPERATOR VALUE
	
	Recognized attributes:

		LOGIN	- The user's login name.
		UID	- The user's UID.
		GID	- The user's primary GID.
		SHELL	- The user's shell.
		HOME	- The user's home directory.

	Recognized operators:

		<		- Arithmetic less-than.
		<=		- Arithmetic less-than-or-equal-to.
		>		- Arithmetic greater-than.
		>=		- Arithmetic greater-than-or-equal-to.
		eq		- Arithmetic equality.
		=		- String equality.
		ne		- Arithmetic inequality.
		!=		- String inequality.
		=~		- Wildcard match.
		!~		- Wildcard mismatch.
		ingroup		- Group membership check. [*]
		notingroup	- Group non-membership check. [*]
		innetgr		- Netgroup membership check. [*][+]
		notinnetgr	- Netgroup non-membership check. [*][+]

		* The "ingroup", "notingroup", "innetgr" and "notinnetgr"
		  operators should only be used with the USER attribute.

		+ The "innetgr" and "notinnetgr" operators always match
		  both remote host and USER against the netgroup. If a remote
		  host is not set by the application it will be matched
		  against any host in the netgroup triplet.
	Examples:

		Deny authentication to all users except those in the wheel
		group, before even asking for a password:
			auth requisite pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup wheel

		Assume all users with UID less than 500 ("system users") have
		valid accounts.
			account sufficient pam_succeed_if.so uid < 500

		Deny login to all nologin users.
			auth requisite pam_succeed_if.so shell !~ nologin

RECOGNIZED ARGUMENTS:
	debug		write debugging messages to syslog
	use_uid 	perform checks on the account of the user under whose
			UID the application is running instead of the user
			being authenticated
	quiet		don't log failure or success to syslog
	quiet_fail	don't log failure to syslog
	quiet_success	don't log success to syslog
