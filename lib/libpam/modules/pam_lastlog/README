pam_lastlogin: The last login module

This module can be used as session entry to provide a `Last login on ...'
message. When the user logs into the system from what ever application
uses the PAM libraries.  In addition, the module maintains the
/var/log/lastlog file and the wtmp entry.


The behavior of this module can be modified with one of the following
flags:

 * debug - write more information to syslog(3).

 * nodate - neglect to give the date of the last login when displaying
            information about the last login on the system.

 * noterm - neglect to diplay the terminal name on which the last
            login was attempt.

 * nohost - neglect to indicate from which host the last login was
            attempted.

 * silent - neglect to inform the user about any previous login:
            just update the /var/log/lastlog file.

 * never - if the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old
           entries for the user, indicate that the user has never
           previously logged in with a ``welcome..." message.

 * nowtmp - Don't update the wtmp entry.
