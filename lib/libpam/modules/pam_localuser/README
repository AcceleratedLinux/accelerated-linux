pam_localuser:
	Succeeds iff the PAM_USER is listed in /etc/passwd.  This seems to be a
	common policy need (allowing only a subset of network-wide users, and
	any locally-defined users, to access services).  Simpler than using
	awk to generate a file for use with pam_listfile (-F: '{print $1}'),
	I guess.

RECOGNIZED ARGUMENTS:
	debug		write debugging messages to syslog
	file=FILE	scan FILE instead of /etc/passwd

MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED:
	auth,account	scan the FILE (/etc/passwd by default) and return
			a success code if an entry is found for the user
