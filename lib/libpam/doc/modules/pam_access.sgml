Through <tt/PAM_TTY/ if set, otherwise attempts getting tty name of
the stdin file descriptor with <tt/ttyname()/.  Standard
gethostname(), <tt/yp_get_default_domain()/, <tt/gethostbyname()/
calls.  <bf/NIS/ is used for netgroup support.

<tag><bf>Description:</bf></tag>

This module provides logdaemon style login access control based on
login names and on host (or domain) names, internet addresses (or
network numbers), or on terminal line names in case of non-networked
logins. Diagnostics are reported through <tt/syslog(3)/.  Wietse
Venema's <tt/login_access.c/ from <em/logdaemon-5.6/ is used with
several changes by A. Nogin.

<p> 
The behavior of this module can be modified with the following 
arguments: 
<itemize> 
 
<item><tt>accessfile=/path/to/file.conf</tt> - 
indicate an alternative <em/access/ configuration file to override 
the default. This can be useful when different services need different 
access lists. 

<item><tt>fieldsep=<it>separators</it></tt> -
this option modifies the field separator character that
<tt/pam_access/ will recognize when parsing the access configuration
file. For example: <tt>fieldsep=|</tt> will cause the default `:'
character to be treated as part of a field value and `|' becomes the
field separator. Doing this is useful in conjuction with a system that
wants to use pam_access with X based applications, since the
<tt/PAM_TTY/ item is likely to be of the form "hostname:0" which
includes a `:' character in its value.

<item><tt>listsep=<it>separators</it></tt> -
this option modifies the list separator character that
<tt/pam_access/ will recognize when parsing the access configuration
file. For example: <tt>listsep=,</tt> will cause the default ` ' and `\t'
characters to be treated as part of a list element value and `,' becomes the
only list element separator. Doing this is useful on a system with
group information obtained from a Windows domain, where the default built-in
groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins" contain a space.

</itemize> 

<tag><bf>Examples/suggested usage:</bf></tag>

Use of module is recommended, for example, on administrative machines
such as <bf/NIS/ servers and mail servers where you need several accounts
active but don't want them all to have login capability.

For <tt>/etc/pam.d</tt> style configurations where your modules live
in <tt>/lib/security</tt>, start by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/pam.d/login</tt>, <tt>/etc/pam.d/rlogin</tt>,
<tt>/etc/pam.d/rsh</tt> and <tt>/etc/pam.d/ftp</tt>:

<tscreen>
<verb>
account  required       /lib/security/pam_access.so
</verb>
</tscreen>

Note that use of this module is not effective unless your system ignores
<tt>.rhosts</tt> files.  See the the pam_rhosts_auth documentation.

A sample <tt>access.conf</tt> configuration file is included with the
distribution.
