<sect2>Overview of module

<p>
This module is intended to provide a transparent wrapper around the
average user, one that puts them in a fake file-system (eg, their
'<tt>/</tt>' is really <tt>/some/where/else</tt>).

<p>
Useful if you have several classes of users, and are slightly paranoid
about security.  Can be used to limit who else users can see on the
system, and to limit the selection of programs they can run.

<tag><bf>Description:</bf></tag>

<tag><bf>Examples/suggested usage:</bf></tag>
Do provide a reasonable list of programs - just tossing 'cat', 'ls', 'rm',
'cp' and 'ed' in there is a bit... 
<p>
Don't take it to extremes (eg, you can set up a separate environment for
each user, but its a big waste of your disk space.)
