<tag><bf>Description:</bf></tag>

This module is used to enforce the so-called <em/wheel/ group.  By
default, it permits root access to the system if the applicant user is
a member of the <tt/wheel/ group (first, the module checks for the
existence of a '<tt/wheel/' group. Otherwise the module defines the
group with group-id <tt/0/ to be the <em/wheel/ group).

<p>
The module can be used as either an '<tt/auth/' or an '<tt/account/'
module.

<p>
The action of the module may be modified from this default by one or
more of the following flags in the <tt>/etc/pam.conf</tt> file.
<itemize>
<item>
<tt/debug/ -
Supply more debugging information to <tt/syslog(3)/.

<item>
<tt/use_uid/ -
This option modifies the behavior of the module by using the current
<tt/uid/ of the process and not the <tt/getlogin(3)/ name of the user.
This option is useful for being able to jump from one account to
another, for example with 'su'.

<item>
<tt/trust/ -
This option instructs the module to return <tt/PAM_SUCCESS/ should it
find the user applying for root privilege is a member of the wheel
group. The default action is to return <tt/PAM_IGNORE/ in this
situation. By using the <tt/trust/ option it is possible to arrange
for <tt/wheel/-group members to become root without typing a
password. <bf/USE WITH CARE/.

<item>
<tt/deny/ - 
This is used to reverse the logic of the module's behavior.  If the
user is trying to get <tt/uid=0/ access and is a member of the wheel
group, deny access (for the wheel group, this is perhaps nonsense!):
it is intended for use in conjunction with the <tt/group=/ argument...
Conversely, if the user is not in the group, return <tt/PAM_IGNORE/
(unless <tt/trust/ was also specified, in which case we return
<tt/PAM_SUCCESS/).

<item>
<tt/group=XXXX/ -
Instead of checking the <tt/gid=0/ group, use the user's <tt/XXXX/
group membership for the authentication. Here, <tt/XXXX/ is the name
of the group and <bf/not/ its numeric identifier.

</itemize>

<tag><bf>Examples/suggested usage:</bf></tag>

To restrict access to superuser status to the members of the
<tt/wheel/ group, use the following entries in your configuration
file:
<tscreen>
<verb>
#
# root gains access by default (rootok), only wheel members can 
# become root (wheel) but Unix authenticate non-root applicants.
#
su	auth	 sufficient	pam_rootok.so
su	auth	 required	pam_wheel.so
su	auth	 required	pam_unix.so
</verb>
</tscreen>

</descrip>
