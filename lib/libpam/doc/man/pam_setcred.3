.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pam_setcred

This function is used to establish, maintain and delete the
credentials of a user. It should be called after a user has been
authenticated and before a session is opened for the user (with
.BR pam_open_session "(3))."

It should be noted that credentials come in many forms. Examples
include: group memberships; ticket-files; and Linux-PAM environment
variables.  For this reason, it is important that the basic identity
of the user is established, by the application, prior to a call to
this function.  For example, the default
.BR Linux-PAM
environment variables should be set and also
.BR initgroups "(2) "
(or equivalent) should have been performed.

.SH "VALID FLAGS"

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
