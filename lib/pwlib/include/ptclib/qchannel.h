/** Class for implementing a serial queue channel in memory.
    This implements a simple memory based First In First Out queue. Data
    written to an instance of the class may be read from the same instance at
    some later time.

    The queue will block the read for the Read Timeout if the queue is empty.
    Similarly a write will be clocked for Write Timeout if the queue is full.

    If there is any data to be read then it returns immediately with those
    bytes, so you must check the GetLastReadCount() to determine the actual
    number of bytes read and not rely on the count being passed into the read
    function.
