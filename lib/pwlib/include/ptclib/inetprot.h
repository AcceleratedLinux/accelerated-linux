/** A TCP/IP socket for process/application layer high level protocols. All of
   these protocols execute commands and responses in a standard manner.

   A command consists of a line starting with a short, case insensitive command
   string terminated by a space or the end of the line. This may be followed
   by optional arguments.

   A response to a command is usually a number and/or a short string eg "OK".
   The response may be followed by additional information about the response
   but this is not typically used by the protocol. It is only for user
   information and may be tracked in log files etc.

   All command and reponse lines of the protocol are terminated by a CR/LF
   pair. A command or response line may be followed by additional data as
   determined by the protocol, but this data is "outside" the protocol
   specification as defined by this class.

   The default read timeout is to 10 minutes by the constructor.
