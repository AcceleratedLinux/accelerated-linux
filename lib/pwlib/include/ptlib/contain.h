// Abstract container class

/** Abstract class to embody the base functionality of a {\it container}.

Fundamentally, a container is an object that contains other objects. There
are two main areas of support for tha that are provided by this class. The
first is simply to keep a count of the number of things that the container
contains. The current size is stored and accessed by members of this class.
The setting of size is determined by the semantics of the descendent class
and so is a pure function.

The second area of support is for reference integrity. When an instance of
a container is copied to another instance, the two instance contain the
same thing. There can therefore be multiple references to the same things.
When one reference is destroyed this must {\bf not} destroy the contained
object as it may be referenced by another instance of a container class.
To this end a reference count is provided by the PContainer class. This
assures that the container only destroys the objects it contains when there
are no more references to them.

In support of this, descendent classes must provide a #DestroyContents()#
function. As the normal destructor cannot be used, this function will free
the memory or unlock the resource the container is wrapping.

/**Macro to declare funtions required in a container.
   This macro is used to declare all the functions that should be implemented

   some standard function behaviour.

   This may be used when multiple inheritance requires a special class
   declaration. Normally, the #PDECLARE_CONTAINER# macro would be used,
   which includes this macro in it.

   The default implementation for contructors, destructor, the assignment
   operator and the MakeUnique() function is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
        cls(const cls & c)
          : par(c)
        {

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Abstract collection of objects class

/**A collection is a container that collects together descendents of the
   #PObject# class. The objects contained in the collection are always
   pointers to objects, not the objects themselves. The life of an object in
   the collection should be carefully considered. Typically, it is allocated
   by the user of the collection when it is added. The collection then
   automatically deletes it when it is removed or the collection is destroyed,
   ie when the container class has no more references to the collection. Other
   models may be accommodated but it is up to the programmer to determine the
   scope and life of the objects.

   The exact form of the collection depends on the descendent of PCollection
   and determines the access modes for the objects in it. Thus a collection
   can be an array which allows fast random access at the expense of slow
   insertion and deletion. Or the collection may be a list which has fast
   insertion and deletion but very slow random access.

   The basic paradigm of all collections is the "virtual array". Regardless of
   the internal implementation of the collection; array, list, sorted list etc,
   the user may access elements via an ordinal index. The implementation then
   optimises the access as best it can. For instance, in a list ordinal zero
   will go directly to the head of the list. Stepping along sequential indexes
   then will return the next element of the list, remembering the new position
   at each step, thus allowing sequential access with little overhead as is
   expected for lists. If a random location is specified, then the list
   implementation must sequentially search for that ordinal from either the
   last location or an end of the list, incurring an overhead.

   All collection classes implement a base set of functions, though they may
   be meaningless or degenerative in some collection types eg #Insert()#
   for #PSortedList# will degenerate to be the same as #Append()#.
