 * include/ptlib/channel.h, include/ptlib/pstring.h, src/ptlib/common/contain.cxx,
 * src/ptlib/common/pchannel.cxx:
 *   correct the STL defined checking to use proper syntax.
 *
 * include/ptlib/object.h:
 *   re-add typedef to compile on mingw
 *

// PString class

class PStringArray;
class PRegularExpression;

/**The character string class. It supports a wealth of additional functions
   for string processing and conversion. Operators are provided so that
   strings can virtually be treated as a basic type.

   An important feature of the string class, which is not present in other
   container classes, is that when the string contents is changed, that is
   resized or elements set, the string is "dereferenced", and a duplicate
   made of its contents. That is this instance of the array is disconnected
   from all other references to the string data, if any, and a new string array
   contents created. For example consider the following:
\begin{verbatim}
          PString s1 = "String"; // New array allocated and set to "String"
          PString s2 = s1;       // s2 has pointer to same array as s1
                                 // and reference count is 2 for both
          s1[0] = 's';           // Breaks references into different strings
\end{verbatim}
   at the end s1 is "string" and s2 is "String" both with reference count of 1.

   The functions that will "break" a reference are #SetSize()#,
   #SetMinSize()#, #GetPointer()#, #SetAt()# and
   #operator[]#.

   Note that the array is a '\0' terminated string as in C strings. Thus the
   memory allocated, and the length of the string may be different values.

   Also note that the PString is inherently an 8 bit string. The character set
   is not defined for most operations and it may be any 8 bit character set.
   However when conversions are being made to or from 2 byte formats then the
   PString is assumed to be the UTF-8 format. The 2 byte format is nominally
   UCS-2 (aka BMP string) and while it is not exactly the same as UNICODE
   they are compatible enough for them to be treated the same for most real
   world usage.
