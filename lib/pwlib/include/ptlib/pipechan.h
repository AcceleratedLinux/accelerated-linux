/**A channel that uses a operating system pipe between the current process and
   a sub-process. On platforms that support {\it multi-processing}, the
   sub-program is executed concurrently with the calling process.
   
   Where full multi-processing is not supported then the sub-program is run
   with its input supplied from, or output captured to, a disk file. The
   current process is then suspended during the execution of the sub-program.
   In the latter case the semantics of the #Execute()# and #Close()#
   functions change from the usual for channels.

   Note that for platforms that do not support multi-processing, the current
   process is suspended until the sub-program terminates. The input and output
   of the sub-program is transferred via a temporary file. The exact moment of
   execution of the sub-program depends on the mode. If mode is
   #ReadOnly# then it is executed immediately and its output
   captured. In #WriteOnly# mode the sub-program is run when the
   #Close()# function is called, or when the pipe channel is destroyed.
   In #ReadWrite# mode the sub-program is run when the
   #Execute()# function is called indicating that the output from the
   current process to the sub-program has completed and input is now desired.
   
   The #CanReadAndWrite()# function effectively determines whether full
   multi-processing is supported by the platform. Note that this is different
   to whether {\it multi-threading} is supported.
