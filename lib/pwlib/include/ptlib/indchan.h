 * $Log: indchan.h,v $
 * Revision 1.10  2005/11/25 03:43:47  csoutheren
 * Fixed function argument comments to be compatible with Doxygen
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2002/09/16 01:08:59  robertj
 * Added #define so can select if #pragma interface/implementation is used on
 *   platform basis (eg MacOS) rather than compiler, thanks Robert Monaghan.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2001/09/10 02:51:22  robertj
 * Major change to fix problem with error codes being corrupted in a
 *   PChannel when have simultaneous reads and writes in threads.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/05/22 12:49:32  robertj
 * Did some seriously wierd rewrite of platform headers to eliminate the
