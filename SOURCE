SOURCE TREE AND LAYOUT
----------------------

The sources in this build have come from many places. Everything in
this package is covered by some type of open source or public domain
license. GNU copyleft is the most prevelant, but check within each
package for its specific licsense if you have concerns.


The directories:

Documentation -- Useful notes related to building and using specific targets.
                 Also some useful notes related to this distribution.

linux         -- linux sources from kernel.org (+ changes)

lib           -- Application libraries.

uClibc        -- An alternate libc from www.uClibc.org

glibc         -- Standard GNU libc

user          -- User mode applications, source from many, many places.
                 Too many places to enumerate, most are standard GNU/Linux
                 packages, all are freely available on the net somewhere.
                 Some applications have been developed locally (in tree).

openswan      -- Openswan from www.openswan.org

vendors       -- Plaform specific build information and support files.
                 Layed out for each specific vendor and board, contains
                 default configurations and make instructions.

tools         -- Supporting tools used by the build
                 (also contains some debugger stubs and aids)

bin           -- Supporting scripts used by some targets to build

config        -- Linux kernel config scripts used to drive the
                 vendor/platform configuration.


The following directories hold results of the build process:

include       -- Layout for target include files used to build libs/apps.

staging       -- Layout of target system libs for building.

romfs         -- Is the structrue of the root file system. Mostly it holds
                 the user application binaries, but also has device nodes,
                 configuration files, shared libraries, etc.

images        -- Contains the final build binaries of the kernel, root file
                 system, and often a complete combined image.
