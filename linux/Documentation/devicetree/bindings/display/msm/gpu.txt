Qualcomm adreno/snapdragon GPU

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,adreno-XYZ.W", "qcom,adreno" or
	      "amd,imageon-XYZ.W", "amd,imageon"
    for example: "qcom,adreno-306.0", "qcom,adreno"
  Note that you need to list the less specific "qcom,adreno" (since this
  is what the device is matched on), in addition to the more specific
  with the chip-id.
  If "amd,imageon" is used, there should be no top level msm device.
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the gpu.
- clocks: device clocks (if applicable)
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required by a3xx, a4xx and a5xx
  cores:
  * "core"
  * "iface"
  * "mem_iface"
  For GMU attached devices the GPU clocks are not used and are not required. The
  following devices should not list clocks:
   - qcom,adreno-630.2
- iommus: optional phandle to an adreno iommu instance
- operating-points-v2: optional phandle to the OPP operating points
- qcom,gmu: For GMU attached devices a phandle to the GMU device that will
  control the power for the GPU. Applicable targets:
    - qcom,adreno-630.2

Example 3xx/4xx/a5xx:

/ {
	...

	gpu: qcom,kgsl-3d0@4300000 {
		compatible = "qcom,adreno-320.2", "qcom,adreno";
		reg = <0x04300000 0x20000>;
		reg-names = "kgsl_3d0_reg_memory";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 80 0>;
		clock-names =
		    "core",
		    "iface",
		    "mem_iface";
		clocks =
		    <&mmcc GFX3D_CLK>,
		    <&mmcc GFX3D_AHB_CLK>,
		    <&mmcc MMSS_IMEM_AHB_CLK>;
	};
};

Example a6xx (with GMU):

/ {
	...

	gpu@5000000 {
		compatible = "qcom,adreno-630.2", "qcom,adreno";
		#stream-id-cells = <16>;

		reg = <0x5000000 0x40000>, <0x509e000 0x10>;
		reg-names = "kgsl_3d0_reg_memory", "cx_mem";

		/*
		 * Look ma, no clocks! The GPU clocks and power are
		 * controlled entirely by the GMU
		 */

		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 300 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		iommus = <&adreno_smmu 0>;

		operating-points-v2 = <&gpu_opp_table>;

		qcom,gmu = <&gmu>;
	};
};
