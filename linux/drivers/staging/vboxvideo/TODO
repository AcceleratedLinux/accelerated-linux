TODO:
-Get a full review from the drm-maintainers on dri-devel done on this driver
-Drop all the logic around initial_mode_queried, the master_set and
 master_drop callbacks and everything related to this. kms clients can handle
 hotplugs.
-Extend this TODO with the results of that review

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>,
Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>, Michael Thayer <michael.thayer@oracle.com>
and dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org .
