config WLAN_VENDOR_ATH
	bool "Atheros/Qualcomm devices"
	default y
	help
	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about these cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  For more information and documentation on this module you can visit:

config ATH_DEBUG
	bool "Atheros wireless debugging"
	help
	  Say Y, if you want to debug atheros wireless drivers.
	  Right now only ath9k makes use of this.

config ATH_TRACEPOINTS
	bool "Atheros wireless tracing"
	depends on ATH_DEBUG
	depends on EVENT_TRACING
	help
	  This option enables tracepoints for atheros wireless drivers.
	  Currently, ath9k makes use of this facility.

config ATH_REG_DYNAMIC_USER_REG_HINTS
	bool "Atheros dynamic user regulatory hints"
	depends on CFG80211_CERTIFICATION_ONUS
	default n
	help
	  Say N. This should only be enabled in countries where
	  this feature is explicitly allowed and only on cards that
	  specifically have been tested for this.

config ATH_REG_DYNAMIC_USER_CERT_TESTING
	bool "Atheros dynamic user regulatory testing"
	depends on ATH_REG_DYNAMIC_USER_REG_HINTS && CFG80211_CERTIFICATION_ONUS
	default n
	help
	  Say N. This should only be enabled on systems
	  undergoing certification testing.


config ATH_REG_NO_FORCED_RADAR
	bool "Atheros regulatory radar/IR override"
	depends on CFG80211_CERTIFICATION_ONUS
	default n
	help
	  Do not force radar or IR flags channels. This option should be
	  enabled with the intent to have userspace manage the regulatory
	  domain through e.g. CRDA.

config ATH_REG_FORCE_NONE
	bool
	prompt "No forced regulatory domain"
	help
	  Select this option to respect the country code read from the
	  radio's EEPROM.

config ATH_REG_FORCE_UNRESTRICTED
	bool
	prompt "Unrestricted regulatory domain"
	help
	  Select this option to ignore the country code from the EEPROM
	  and use an unrestricted "global" regulatory domain.
	  This option should be enabled with the intent to have userspace
	  manage the regulatory domain through e.g. CRDA.

config ATH_REG_FORCE_DEFAULT
	bool
	prompt "Default regulatory domain"
	help
	  Select this option to pretend the country code read from the
	  EEPROM was 0x00 which corresponds to the "default" country
	  which is hardcoded in the driver as the UNITED STATES.
