config WILCO_EC

	help
	  If you say Y here, you get support for talking to the ChromeOS
	  Wilco EC over an eSPI bus. This uses a simple byte-level protocol
	  with a checksum.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called wilco_ec.

config WILCO_EC_DEBUGFS
	tristate "Enable raw access to EC via debugfs"
	depends on WILCO_EC
	help
	  If you say Y here, you get support for sending raw commands to
	  the Wilco EC via debugfs.  These commands do not do any byte
	  manipulation and allow for testing arbitrary commands.  This
	  interface is intended for debug only and will not be present
	  on production devices.
