## Web proxy, following the grand tradition of Web things being handled by
## gross scripts.  Uses netcat to listen on a high port [default 8000],
## picks apart requests and sends them on to the right place.  Point this
## at the browser client machine you'll be coming from [to limit access to
## only it], and point the browser's concept of an HTTP proxy to the
## machine running this.  Takes a single argument of the client that will
## be using it, and rejects connections from elsewhere.  LOGS the queries
## to a configurable logfile, which can be an interesting read later on!
## If the argument is "reset", the listener and logfile are cleaned up.
##
## This works surprisingly fast and well, for a shell script, although may
## randomly fail when hammered by a browser that tries to open several
## connections at once.  Drop the "maximum connections" in your browser if
## this is a problem.
##
## A more degenerate case of this, or preferably a small C program that
## does the same thing under inetd, could handle a small site's worth of
## proxy queries.  Given the way browsers are evolving, proxies like this
## can play an important role in protecting your own privacy.
##
## If you grabbed this in ASCII mode, search down for "eew" and make sure
## the embedded-CR check is intact, or requests might hang.
##
## Doesn't handle POST forms.  Who cares, if you're just watching HTTV?
## Dumbness here has a highly desirable side effect: it only sends the first
## GET line, since that's all you really ever need to send, and suppresses
## the other somewhat revealing trash that most browsers insist on sending.
##
## To use the proxy, export `http_proxy' in your environment, e.g.
## `http_proxy=http://localhost:8000'.

# CFILE=${0}.conn
# optional extra args to the listener "nc", for instance "-s inside-net-addr"

# functionality switch has to be done fast, so the next listener can start
# prelaunch check: if no current client and no args, bail.
