.SH "NAME"
lwdnsq \- lookup items in DNS to help pluto (and others)

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBipsec lwdnsq\fR
is a helper program that does DNS lookups for other programs\&. It implements an asynchronous interface on stdin/stdout, with an ASCII driven command language\&.
.PP
If stdin is a tty or if the
\fB\-\-prompt\fR
option is given, then it issues a prompt to the user\&. Otherwise, it is silent, except for results\&.
.PP
The program will accept multiple queries concurrently, with each result being marked with the ID provided on the output\&. The IDs are strings\&.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\-serial\fR
option is given, then the program will not attempt to execute concurrent queries, but will serialize all input and output\&.
.SH "QUERY LANGUAGE"
.PP
There are twelve commands that the program understands\&. This is to lookup different types of records in both the forward and reverse maps\&. Every query includes a queryid, which is returned in the output, on every single line to identify the transaction\&.
.SS "HELP"
.PP
This request lists the available commands
.SS "QUIT"
.PP
This request causes lwdnsq to quit\&.

.SS "KEY6 queryid A:B::C:D"
.PP

.SH "REPLIES TO QUERIES"
.PP
All replies from the queries are in the following format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

<ID> <TIME> <TTL> <TYPE> <TYPE\-SPECIFIC> \en

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fIID\fR
.RS 4
this is the
\fBqueryid\fR
value that was provided in the query\&. It is repeated on every line to permit the replies to be properly associated with the query\&. When the response is not ascribable to particular query (such as for a mis\-formed query), then the query ID "0" will be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fITIME\fR
.RS 4
this is the current time in seconds since epoch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fITTL\fR
.RS 4
for answers which have a time to live, this is the current value\&. The answer is valid for this number of seconds\&. If there is no useful value here, then the number 0 is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fITYPE\fR
.RS 4
This is the type of the record that is being returned\&. The types are described in the next section\&. The TYPE specific data that follows is specific to the type\&.
.RE
.PP
The replies are limited to 4096 bytes, a value defined as
\fBLWDNSQ_RESULT_LEN_MAX\fR\&. This is defined in
\fIfreeswan\&.h\fR\&.
.PP
All of the replies which include resource records use the standard presentation format (with no line feeds or carriage returns) in their answer\&.
.SS "START"
.PP
This reply indicates that a query has been received and has been started\&. It serves as an anchor point for timing, as well as an acknowledgement\&.
.SS "DONE"
.PP
This reply indicates that a query is entirely over, and no further information from this query will be sent\&.
.SS "RETRY"
.PP
This reply indicates that a query is entirely over, but that no data was found\&. The records may exist, but appropriate servers could not be reached\&.
.SS "FATAL"
.PP
This reply indicates that a query is entirely over, and that no data of the type requested could be found\&. There were no timeouts, and all servers were available and confirmed non\-existances\&. There may be NXT records returned prior to this\&.
.SS "CNAME"
.PP
This is an interim reply, and indicates that a CNAME was found (and followed) while performing the query\&. The value of the CNAME is present in the type specific section\&.
.SS "CNAMEFROM"
.PP
This is an interim reply, and indicates that a CNAME was found\&. The original name that was queries for was not the canonical name, and this reply indicates the name that was actually followed\&.
.SS "NAME"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. The original name that was queries for was not the canonical name\&. This reply indicates the canonical name\&.
.SS "DNSSEC"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. It is followed either by "OKAY" or "not present\&. It indicates if DNSSEC was available on the reply\&.
.SS "TXT and AD\-TXT"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. If there are TXT resource records in the reply, then each one is presented using this type\&. If preceded by AD\-, then this record was signed with DNSSEC\&.
.SS "A and AD\-A"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. If there are A resource records in the reply, then each one is presented using this type\&. If preceded by AD\-, then this record was signed with DNSSEC\&.
.SS "AAAA and AD\-AAAA"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. If there are AAAA resource records in the reply, then each one is presented using this type\&. If preceded by AD\-, then this record was signed with DNSSEC\&.
.SS "PTR and AD\-PTR"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. If there are PTR resource records in the reply, then each one is presented using this type\&. If preceded by AD\-, then this record was signed with DNSSEC\&.
.SS "KEY and AD\-KEY"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. If there are KEY resource records in the reply, then each one is presented using this type\&. If preceded by AD\-, then this record was signed with DNSSEC\&.
.SS "IPSECKEY and AD\-IPSECKEY"
.PP
This is an interim reply\&. If there are IPSEC resource records in the reply, then each one is presented using this type\&. If preceded by AD\-, then this record was signed with DNSSEC\&.
.SH "SPECIAL IPSECKEY PROCESSING"
.PP
At the time of this writing, the IPSECKEY resource record is not entirely specified\&. In particular no resource record number has been assigned\&. This program assumes that it is resource record number 45\&. If the file /etc/ipsec\&.d/lwdnsq\&.conf exists, and contains a line like
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

ipseckey_rr=\fBnumber\fR

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
then this number will be used instead\&. The file is read only once at startup\&.
.SH "OE DIRECTIVES"
.PP
If the file /etc/ipsec\&.d/lwdnsq\&.conf exists, and contains a line like
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

queryany=false

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
then instead of doing an ALL query when looking for OE delegation records, lwdnsq will do a series of queries\&. It will first look for IPSECKEY, and then TXT record\&. If it finds neither, it will then look for KEY records of all kinds, although they do not contain delegation information\&.
.SH "SPECIAL IPSECKEY PROCESSING"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

/etc/ipsec\&.d/lwdnsq\&.conf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Not all listed commands are actually implemented\&.
