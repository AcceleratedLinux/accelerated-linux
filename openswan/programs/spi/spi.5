Note that eroute is only supported on the classic KLIPS stack\&. It is not supported on any other stack and will be completely removed in future versions\&. A replacement command still needs to be designed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
/proc/net/ipsec_spi
is a read\-only file that lists the current IPSEC Security Associations\&. A Security Association (SA) is a transform through which packet contents are to be processed before being forwarded\&. A transform can be an IPv4\-in\-IPv4 or IPv6\-in\-IPv6 encapsulation, an IPSEC Authentication Header (authentication with no encryption), or an IPSEC Encapsulation Security Payload (encryption, possibly including authentication)\&.
.PP
When a packet is passed from a higher networking layer through an IPSEC virtual interface, a search in the extended routing table (see
\fBipsec_eroute\fR(5)) yields a IP protocol number , a Security Parameters Index (SPI) and an effective destination address When an IPSEC packet arrives from the network, its ostensible destination, an SPI and an IP protocol specified by its outermost IPSEC header are used\&. The destination/SPI/protocol combination is used to select a relevant SA\&. (See
\fBipsec_spigrp\fR(5)
for discussion of how multiple transforms are combined\&.)
.PP
An
\fIspi ,\fR
\fIproto,\fR
\fIdaddr\fR
and
\fIaddress_family\fR
arguments specify an SAID\&.
\fIProto\fR
is an ASCII string, "ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun", specifying the IP protocol\&.
\fISpi\fR
is a number, preceded by \'\&.\' indicating hexadecimal and IPv4 or by \':\' indicating hexadecimal and IPv6, where each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, between
\fB0x100\fR
and
\fB0xffffffff\fR; values from
\fB0x0\fR
to
\fB0xff\fR
are reserved\&.
\fIDaddr\fR
is a dotted\-decimal IPv4 destination address or a coloned hex IPv6 destination address\&.
.PP
An
\fISAID\fR
combines the three parameters above, such as: "tun\&.101@1\&.2\&.3\&.4" for IPv4 or "tun:101@3049:1::1" for IPv6

The add and use times are awkward, displayed in seconds since machine start\&. It would be better to display them in seconds before now for human readability\&.
