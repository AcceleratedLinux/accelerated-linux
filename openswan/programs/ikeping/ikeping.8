.SH "NAME"
ipsec_ikeping \- send/receive ISAKMP/IKE echo requests/replies
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBipsec\fR \fIikeping\fR [\-\-listen] [\-\-verbose] [\-\-wait\ \fItime\fR] [\-\-exchangenum\ \fInum\fR] [\-\-ikeport\ \fIlocalport\fR] [\-\-ikeaddress\ \fIaddress\fR] [\-\-inet] [\-\-inet6] \fIdestaddr\fR [\fI/dstport\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIIkeping\fR
sends and receives ISAKMP/IKE echo request and echo reply packets\&. These packets are intended for diagnostics purposes, in a manner similar to
\fBping\fR(8)
does for ICMP echo request/reply packets\&.
.PP
At the time of this writing, the ISAKMP echo request/reply exchange is still an internet\-draft (draft\-richardson\-ipsec\-ikeping\-00), and is therefore completely non\-standard\&. The Openswan IKE daemon pluto does implement this draft, so ikeping can be used to test connectivity to an openswan ipsec server\&.
.PP
\fIIkeping\fR
will bind to the local address given by
\fB\-\-ikeaddress\fR
and the port number given by
\fB\-\-ikeport\fR
defaulting to the wildcard address and the ISAKMP port 500\&. An ISAKMP exchange of type 244 (a private use number) is sent to each of the address/ports listed on the command line\&. The exchange number may be overridden by the
\fB\-\-exchangenum\fR
option\&.
.PP
\fIIkeping\fR
then listens for replies, printing them as they are received\&. Replies are of exchange type 245 or the specified exchange number plus 1\&.
\fIIkeping\fR
will keep listening until it either receives as many echo responses as it sent, or until the timeout period (5 seconds) has been reached\&. Receipt of a packet will reset the timer\&. The
\fB\-\-wait\fR
option can be used to specify a different timeout period\&.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\-listen\fR
option is given, then
\fIikeping\fR
will not send any packets\&. Instead, it will listen for them and reply to each request received\&.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\-natt\fR
option is given, then
\fIikeping\fR
will set the socket to permit UDP encapsulated ESP packets\&. This is only useful in listen mode\&.
