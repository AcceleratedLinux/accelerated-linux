<para>shell command to run after starting Pluto
(e.g., to remove a decrypted copy of the
<emphasis remap='I'>ipsec.secrets</emphasis>
file).
It's run in a very simple way;
complexities like I/O redirection are best hidden within a script.
Any output is redirected for logging,
so running interactive commands is difficult unless they use
<filename>/dev/tty</filename>
or equivalent for their interaction.
Default is none.</para>
