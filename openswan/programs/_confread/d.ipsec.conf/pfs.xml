<para>whether Perfect Forward Secrecy of keys is desired on the connection's
keying channel
(with PFS, penetration of the key-exchange protocol
does not compromise keys negotiated earlier);
Since there is no reason to ever refuse PFS, Openswan will allow a connection defined with
<emphasis remap='B'>pfs=no</emphasis> to use PFS anyway.
Acceptable values are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>
(the default)
and
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>.</para>
