<para>Set the length of time (in seconds) we will idle without hearing either an
R_U_THERE poll from our peer, or an R_U_THERE_ACK reply.  After this period
has elapsed with no response and no traffic, we will declare the peer dead,
and remove the SA (default
<literal>120</literal>
seconds).  If dpdtimeout is set, dpdaction also needs to be set.</para>
