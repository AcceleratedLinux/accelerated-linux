<para>Use Aggressive Mode instead of Main Mode. Aggressive Mode is less secure,
and vulnerable to Denial Of Service attacks. It is also vulnerable to brute force
attacks with software such as <emphasis remap='B'>ikecrack</emphasis>. It should
not be used, and it should especially not be used with XAUTH and group secrets (PSK).
If the remote system administrator insists on staying irresponsible, enable this option.</para>
<para>Aggressive Mode is further limited to only proposals with one DH group as there is no room to
negotiate the DH group. Therefor it is mandatory for Aggressive Mode connections that both
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='B'>phase2alg=</emphasis> options are
specified with only fully specified proposal using one DH group.
Acceptable values are <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
(the default).</para>
<para>
The ISAKMP SA is created in exchange 1 in aggressive mode. Openswan has to send the exponent
during that exchange, so it has to know what DH group to use before starting. This is why you
can not have multiple DH groups in aggressive mode.  In IKEv2, which uses a similar method to
IKEv1 Aggressive Mode, there is a message to convey the DH group is wrong, and so an IKEv2
connection can actually recover from picking the wrong DH group by restarting its negotiation.
