# The "make doc" fix broke "make install" silently; some man page symlinks
# were being linked incorrectly. This resulted in files which passed the make
# install test but linked to nothing.

# 	manlink -n idea is a fail. It depended upon being able to
# 	read the man page at the installed location, which isn't going
# 	to work consistently. manlink now just generates a list of links
# 	that should be made, leaving the Makefile script to decide what
# 	to do with them. Further, it now processes the files found in the
# 	repository, rather than the ones installed.
