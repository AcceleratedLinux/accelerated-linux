1)	There is some regression with the new parser and recognising
	"time values" (eg 3600, 1h, 10m) when they are just integers.
	So where keylife=3600 will not work, keylife="3600" or keylife=1h
	will work.

2)	We are aware of problems where more than 10 initiations/second may
	cause the system to fail to negotiate ANY SAs. We are not certain
	of the cause, but it is not made better by setting nhelpers=0.
	Note that our previous record for SA setups/second was 11/second, so
	it may well be availability of entropy.
	
3)	There are some interop issues with IKEv2
