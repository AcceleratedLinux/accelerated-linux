libtest paramaters

   The libtest test is for testing library routines. The library file is
   expected to provided an #ifdef by the name of library
   . The libtest type invokes the C compiler to compile this file, links
   it against libfreeswan.a (to resolve any other dependancies) and runs
   the test with the -r argument to invoke a regression test.

   The library test case is expected to do a self-test, exiting with
   status code 0 if everything is okay, and with non-zero otherwise. A
   core dump (exit code greater than 128) is noted specifically.

   Unlike other tests, there are no subdirectories required, or other
   parameters to set.
