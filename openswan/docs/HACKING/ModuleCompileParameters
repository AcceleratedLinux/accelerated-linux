module_compile paramaters

   The module_compile test attempts to build the KLIPS module against a
   given set of kernel source. This is also done by the RPM tests, but in
   a very specific manner.

   There are two variations of this test - one where the kernel either
   doesn't need to be configured, or is already done, and tests were
   there is a local configuration file.

   Where the kernel doesn't need to be configured, the kernel source that
   is found is simply used. It may be a RedHat-style kernel, where one
   can cause it to configure itself via rhconfig.h-style definitions. Or,
   it may just be a kernel tree that has been configured.

   If the variable KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE is set, then a new directory is
   created for the kernel source. It is populated with lndir(1). The
   referenced file is then copied in as .config, and "make oldconfig" is
   used to configure the kernel. This resulting kernel is then used as
   the reference source.

   In all cases, the kernel source is found the same was for the
   kernelpatch test, i.e. via KERNEL_VERSION/KERNEL_NAME and
   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC.

   Once there is kernel source, the module is compiled using the
   top-level "make module" target.

   The test is considered successful if an executable is found in
   OUTPUT/module/ipsec.o at the end of the test.

   KERNEL_NAME
          the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"

   KERNEL_VERSION
          the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".

   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC
          This variable should set in the environment, probably in
          ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
          KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should
          point to an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.

   KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE
          The configuration file for the kernel.

   KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE
          If set to a non-empty string, then the configured kernel source
          is not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be
          set in the environment while debugging.

   MODULE_DEF_INCLUDE
          The include file that will be used to configure the KLIPS
          module, and possibly the kernel source.
