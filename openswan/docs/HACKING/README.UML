How to use UML testing with Openswan

- wget  http://www.openswan.org/download/uml-vm/64bit/centos-hda.img.bz2
- bunzip centos-hda.img.bz2
- configure your VM technology to boot this disk image as a x86_64 machine.
   eg: qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -hda centos-hda.img
   or write a xen HVM config file
   or use virt-install
- Boot the machine and login as "build" with password "openswan"
  (if for some reason you want to login as root, it uses the same password)
- cd openswan-2.6

To run ALL testsm use:

   make check

To run a single test (eg basic-pluto-01), use:

   cd testing/pluto/pluto-basic-01
   ../../utils/runme

To start uml VM's individually:

- cd openswan-2.6/UMLPOOL/hostname/
- to run with netkey: ./start-netkey.sh single
- to run with klips: ./start.sh single

to setup/run a single test using a single booted machine, eg
if you want to setup/run pluto-basic-01 on west, you do:

/testing/pluto/basic-pluto-01/westinit.sh

(do the same on east for east)

on west:

/testing/pluto/basic-pluto-01/westrun.sh
