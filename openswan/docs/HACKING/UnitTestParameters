The Unit Test mechod is designed to use run a test case on the devel host.
It does not invoke a User-Mode-Linux to run the test.

The testparams.sh should specify the following:

   TESTSCRIPT           a script/program to be used to invoke the unit test.
   REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT   a file for reference output.
   REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS   a list of fixups for the console output
   PROGRAMS             a list of subdirs of "programs/" which should be
                        build prior to invoking the test.

If there is a Makefile in the testdir, it will be invoked as "make
checkprograms" before the test is run.

The script/program will be started with:
          ROOTDIR=    set to root of source code.
          OBJDIRTOP=  set to location of object files
