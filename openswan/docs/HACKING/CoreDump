Pluto may core dump. It will normally do so into the current working
directory. The standard scripts have an option dumpdir=, which can set the
current directory to determine where the core dump will go. 

In some cases, it may be more convenient to specify it on the command line
using --coredir. 

A third method is to set the environment variable PLUTO_CORE_DIR. 

The command line argument takes precedence over the environment variable.

One reason to want this is so that one can move the core dump around during
test cases, where editing the ipsec.conf is not convenient.
