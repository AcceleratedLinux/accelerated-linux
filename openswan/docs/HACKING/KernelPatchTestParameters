kernel_patch_test paramaters

   The kernel_patch_test function takes some kernel source, copies it
   with lndir, and then applies the patch as produced by "make
   kernelpatch".

   The following are used to control the input and output to the system:

   KERNEL_NAME
          the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"

   KERNEL_VERSION
          the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".

   KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC
          This variable should set in the environment, probably in
          ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
          KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should
          point to an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.

   REF_PATCH_OUTPUT
          a copy of the patch output to compare against

   KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE
          If set to a non-empty string, then the patched kernel source is
          not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be set
          in the environment while debugging.
