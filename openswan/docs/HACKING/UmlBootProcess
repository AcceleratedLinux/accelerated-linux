Up to kernel 2.6.12, the User-Mode-Linux images have been lazy about /dev.
We just enabled the crappy "devfs" and let it deal. 

That was important because we use hostfs as /.
To have /dev on hostfs, would have meant that we would have to have device
nodes on the host file system, and that would require root on the host to
create them.

The new system is that we have a shell script for /sbin/init.
It mounts /proc, then starts udev, then creates /dev/console, and
then exec's the real /sbin/init.

It seems to work, but in order for the script to start, we have to have
something as /dev/console, and an empty file will do for now.

After 2.6.18, initramfs was better, and this requires that the script works
differently.  Those changes now use "mount --move" instead of "pivot_root".

Openswan uml uses some 64bit specific things to buildan initrd, so it is
recommended to use a 64bit machine to run uml on.

It is likely that UML just does not work in 2.6.26. This is being worked on.
