rpm_build_install_test paramaters

   The rpm_build_install_test type is to verify that the proper packing
   list is produced by "make rpm", and that the mechanisms for building
   the kernel modules produce consistent results.

   RPM_KERNEL_SOURCE
          Point to an extracted copy of the RedHat kernel source code.
          Variables from the environment may be used.

   REF_RPM_CONTENTS
          This is a file containing one record per line. Each record
          consists of a RPM name (may contain wildcards) and a filename
          to compare the contents to. The RPM will be located and a file
          list will be produced with rpm2cpio.
