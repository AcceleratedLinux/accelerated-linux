FreeS/WAN Starter -- Version 0.2       [Contributed by Arkoon Network Security]
================================       [                http://www.arkoon.net/]

FreeS/WAN Starter (FS) is aimed to replace all the scripts which are used to
start and stop FreeS/WAN and to do that in a quicker and a smarter way.

FS can also reload the configuration file (kill --HUP or periodicaly) and
apply the changes.

Usage:
  starter [--debug] [--auto_reload <x seconds>]
    --debug: no fork, all msg (including pluto) are sent to the console
    --auto_reload: reload the config file (like kill -HUP) every x seconds

Send all your comments/requests to me (mlafon@arkoon.net). If you use it and
find it useful, drop me a mail too.


FEATURES
--------

o Load and unload klips (ipsec kernel module)

o Launch and monitor pluto

o Add, initiate, route and del connections

o Attach and detach interfaces according to config file

o kill -HUP can be used to reload the config file. New connections will be
  added, old ones will be removed and modified ones will be reloaded.
  Interfaces/Klips/Pluto will be reloaded if necessary.

o save own pid in /var/run/pluto/starter

o Upon reloading, dynamic DNS addr will be resolved and reloaded. Use
  --auto_reload to periodicaly check dynamic DNS changes.

o kill -USR1 can be used to reload all connections (delete then add and
  route/initiate)

o /var/run/pluto/dynip/xxxx can be used to use a virtual interface name in
  ipsec.conf. By example, when adsl can be ppp0, ppp1, ... :
    ipsec.conf:             interfaces="ipsec0=adsl"
  And use /etc/ppp/ip-up to create /var/run/pluto/dynip/adsl
    /var/run/pluto/dynip/adsl:    IP_PHYS=ppp0

o %auto can be used to automaticaly name the connections

o kill -TERM can be used to stop FS. pluto will be stopped and klips unloaded
  (if it has been loaded).

o Can be used to start FreeS/WAN and load lots of connections in a few
  seconds.
