radauth    1.00  01/13/01  mmiller@hick.org  Matt Miller

OVERVIEW
	
	radauth was developed to allow for command line authentication
	against a radius server.  This allows for more rapid
	testing/troubleshooting of radius authentication problems depending
	upon the method by which the person is authenticating (dial-up
	customers come to mind).  

USAGE

	No command line options are required to be entered for radauth to
	function properly.  For automation, however, command line options
	became necessary.

	-v		verbose output.  This allows you to verify what was
			entered in order to ensure no typo's were made.
	
	-u   username	the clear text version of the persons username.

	-p   password   the clear text version of the persons password.
			(This is not recommended, but has been created for
			ease of use.)
	
	-s   shared     this is the shared secret that the client and radauth
	     secret     will use to communicate with.

	-r   radius	this is the radius server that will be used to
	     server	authenticate off of.

	-c   radius	this is the radius port to be used (default 1812).
	     port

	-t   auth	this defines the auth timeout grace period in seconds.
	     timeout

	-h   		this dispalys the help menu.
	   
COMMON ERROR

	The most common error that I think most people may run into using this
	application is forgetting to add the shared secret entry to their
	clients file for their radius server.  This will case the server to
	silently discard the packets sent to it by radauth, and therefore
	timeout.
