    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The file <filename>/etc/suauth</filename> is referenced whenever the
      su command is called. It can change the behaviour of the su command,
      based upon:
    </para>

    <!-- .RS -->
    <literallayout remap='.nf'>
      1) the user su is targetting
    </literallayout>
    <!-- .fi -->
    <para>
      2) the user executing the su command (or any groups he might be
      a member of)
    </para>

    <para>
      The file is formatted like this, with lines starting with a # being
      treated as comment lines and ignored;
    </para>

    <literallayout remap='RS'>
      to-id:from-id:ACTION
    </literallayout>

    <para>
      Where to-id is either the word <emphasis>ALL</emphasis>, a list of
      usernames delimited by "," or the words <emphasis>ALL
      EXCEPT</emphasis> followed by a list of usernames delimited by ","
    </para>

    <para>
      from-id is formatted the same as to-id except the extra word
      <emphasis>GROUP</emphasis> is recognised. <emphasis>ALL EXCEPT
      GROUP</emphasis> is perfectly valid too. Following
      <emphasis>GROUP</emphasis> appears one or more group names, delimited
      by ",". It is not sufficient to have primary group id of the relevant
      group, an entry in
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>/etc/group</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> is neccessary.
    </para>

    <para> 
      Action can be one only of the following currently supported options.

    </variablelist>

    <para>
      Note there are three separate fields delimited by a colon. No
      whitespace must surround this colon. Also note that the file is
      examined sequentially line by line, and the first applicable rule is
      used without examining the file further. This makes it possible for a
      system administrator to exercise as fine control as he or she wishes.

      There could be plenty lurking. The file parser is particularly
      unforgiving about syntax errors, expecting no spurious whitespace
      (apart from beginning and end of lines), and a specific token
      delimiting different things.
