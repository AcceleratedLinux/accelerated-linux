.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIgetspent\fR,
\fIgetspname\fR,
\fIfgetspent\fR, and
\fIsgetspent\fR
each return a pointer to a
\fIstruct spwd\fR.
\fIgetspent\fR
returns the next entry from the file, and
\fIfgetspent\fR
returns the next entry from the given stream, which is assumed to be a file of the proper format.
\fIsgetspent\fR
returns a pointer to a
\fIstruct spwd\fR
using the provided string as input.
\fIgetspnam\fR
searches from the current position in the file for an entry matching
\fIname\fR.
.PP
\fIsetspent\fR
and
\fIendspent\fR
may be used to begin and end, respectively, access to the shadow password file.
.PP
The
\fIlckpwdf\fR
and
\fIulckpwdf\fR
routines should be used to insure exclusive access to the
\fI/etc/shadow\fR
file.
\fIlckpwdf\fR
attempts to acquire a lock using
\fIpw_lock\fR
for up to 15 seconds. It continues by attempting to acquire a second lock using
\fIspw_lock\fR
for the remainder of the initial 15 seconds. Should either attempt fail after a total of 15 seconds,
\fIlckpwdf\fR
returns \-1. When both locks are acquired 0 is returned.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Routines return NULL if no more entries are available or if an error occurs during processing. Routines which have
\fIint\fR
as the return value return 0 for success and \-1 for failure.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
These routines may only be used by the super user as access to the shadow password file is restricted.
