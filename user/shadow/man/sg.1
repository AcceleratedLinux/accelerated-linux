.HP 3
\fBsg\fR [\-] [group\ [\-c\ ]\ command]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBsg\fR
command works similar to
\fBnewgrp\fR
but accepts a command. The command will be executed with the
\fI/bin/sh\fR
shell. With most shells you may run
\fBsg\fR
from, you need to enclose multi\-word commands in quotes. Another difference between
\fBnewgrp\fR
and
\fBsg\fR
is that some shells treat
\fBnewgrp\fR
specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell that
\fBnewgrp\fR
creates. This doesn't happen with
\fBsg\fR, so upon exit from a
\fBsg\fR
command you are returned to your previous group ID.
