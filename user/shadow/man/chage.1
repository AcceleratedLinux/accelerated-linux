.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-lastday\fR \fILAST_DAY\fR

.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-expiredate\fR \fIEXPIRE_DATE\fR
Set the date number of days since January 1, 1970 on which the user's account will no longer be accessible. The date may also be expressed in the format YYYY\-MM\-DD (or the format more commonly used in your area). A user whose account is locked must contact the system administrator before being able to use the system again.

.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-inactive\fR \fIINACTIVE\fR
Set the number of days of inactivity after a password has expired before the account is locked. The

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-maxdays\fR \fIMAX_DAYS\fR
Set maximum number of days during which a password is valid. When
\fIMAX_DAYS\fR
plus
\fILAST_DAY\fR

\fB\-W\fR

will remove checking a password validation.

.PP
If none of the options are selected,
\fBchage\fR
operates in an interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current values for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line blank to use the current value. The current value is displayed between a pair of
\fI[ ]\fR
marks.
