# Password prompt (%s will be replaced by user name).

# XXX - it doesn't work correctly yet, for now leave it commented out

#
# Only works if compiled with MD5_CRYPT defined:
# If set to "yes", new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based
# algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
# It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings.
# Set to "no" if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems
# which don't understand the new algorithm.  Default is "no".
#
#MD5_CRYPT_ENAB	no

#
# List of groups to add to the user's supplementary group set
# when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE
# setting).  Default is none.

# Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
# access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.
# How to do it is left as an exercise for the reader...

#
# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?

# It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by
# the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).
#
#USERDEL_CMD	/usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# When prompting for password without echo, getpass() can optionally
# display a random number (in the range 1 to GETPASS_ASTERISKS) of '*'
# characters for each character typed.  This feature is designed to
# confuse people looking over your shoulder when you enter a password :-).
# Also, the new getpass() accepts both Backspace (8) and Delete (127)
# keys to delete previous character (to cope with different terminal
# types), Control-U to delete all characters, and beeps when there are
# no more characters to delete, or too many characters entered.
#
# Setting GETPASS_ASTERISKS to 1 results in more traditional behaviour -
# exactly one '*' displayed for each character typed.
#
# Setting GETPASS_ASTERISKS to 0 disables the '*' characters (Backspace,
# Delete, Control-U and beep continue to work as described above).
#
# Setting GETPASS_ASTERISKS to -1 reverts to the traditional getpass()
# without any new features.  This is the default.
#
#GETPASS_ASTERISKS 1

#
# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# This also enables userdel to remove user groups if no members exist.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes
