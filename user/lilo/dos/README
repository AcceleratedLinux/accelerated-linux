	DOS executable 'lilo.com'

Configuration file:	C:\ETC\LILO.CNF
Sector Map file:	C:\BOOT\MAP


1.  The default configuration file may be overridden with the speci-
fication '-C <filename>' on the command line.  '<filename>' may be 
specified literally as "none", for no configuration file.  The only
keyword allowed in the configuration file is "map=", to specify the
name of the sector map file.

2.  The sector map file is 'C:\BOOT\MAP' if no other name is explicitly
specified by "map=" in the configuration file, or '-m <mapfile>' on the
command line.  This file must be the same file as specified in the 
'/etc/lilo.conf' file, except that under Linux, Linux file system naming
applies; whereas under DOS/Windows, DOS file system naming applies.

3.  The sector map file MUST be placed on a filesystem that can be read/
written under both DOS and Linux.  FAT filesystems satisfy this require-
ment.

4.  The 'LILO.COM' executable must be placed somewhere on the executable
path within the DOS/Windows system.  Or it may be referenced by a *.BAT
file on the executable PATH, which provides the opportunity to override
the default configuration and sector map files with command line switches
that will always be seen by the 'LILO.COM' executable.
