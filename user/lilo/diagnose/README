This directory contains the files for making the bootable diagnostic
diskette, version 2.  They are released under the terms of the BSD licence,
contained in the file COPYING in the root LILO source directory.

	sector.S -- the MSDOS boot code which boots HIPBOOT.SYS
	test4.c -- the actual diagnostic


Robert de Bath's "dev-0.16.0" package is REQUIRED to correctly make the
programs in this directory.  The following sources are derived from his
package, are his property, and are released under the 'LGPLicence' contained 
in this directory.

	bios.c -- modified source for the bios_start.o program
	cprintf.c -- modified source for the standalone print routine


The files placed on the MSDOS floppy are as follows:

	test4d.com -- DOS version 2 of the diagnostic, runs under MSDOS;
			useful for capturing output to a file, BUT output is
			not guaranteed to be the same as the standalone
			version 2 program
	test4.com -- standalone version 2 of the diagnostic, bootable if
			copied to 'hipboot.sys'
	disk.com -- version 1 of the disk diagnostic, bootable if copied
			to 'hipboot.sys'
