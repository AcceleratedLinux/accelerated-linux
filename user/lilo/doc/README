Generating the README
=====================

In order to (re)generate the plain ASCII documentation that is found in
lilo/README, Perl 4 or 5 must be installed on your system.
Just type

make ../README

to perform the conversion. Note that fairly large amounts of virtual memory
(16 MB or more) are allocated during the process.


Printing the documentation
==========================

You need the following programs to generate a printable file from the
LaTeX and FIG sources:

  - LaTeX
  - fig2dev from the transfig package (optional)

The LaTeX translations of the FIG files are already included in the
distribution, so you can print the documentation without fig2dev.
WARNING: make spotless  removes those pre-built LaTeX files.

You can also omit all drawings by typing  make dummies . The drawings
are only necessary when processing the technical overview document.

To run LaTeX just type

make

LaTeX issues many "Overfull \hbox" warnings. They can be safely ignored.
LaTeX will be run repeatedly until it stops issuing the message
LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.

Finally, you have to convert the device-independent file doc.dvi to
something your printer understands. The actual command to perform this
depends on your local installation. Example:

dvips user | lpr

(Another way is to use GhostScript. To generate HP DeskJet output by
converting the DVI file to PostScript as an intermediate step, use this
command

dvips -r1 -f1 user | gs -q -sDEVICE=deskjet -sOutputFile=/dev/lp1 -

gs -h  lists all configured drivers.)

If you don't have access to LaTeX but if you can print PostScript, you
should get the file(s) lilo.<part>.<version>.ps.gz from the same place
where you've obtained lilo.<version>.tar.gz  That file contains the
document user.tex (<part> = u) or tech.tex (<part> = t) already translated
to PostScript.
