If you want to NXHost over PPP, Simply execute the following 7 lines
after the ppp connection has been brought up (these are simply the
lines from the rc.net script that signal the nmserver that it should
check for new interfaces.  Note that the kill command does not kill the
nmserver.  Rather, it sends the "USR2" signal to the nmserver.)

#!/bin/sh
#  Let the nmserver know the fruits of our network configuration endeavor.
pid=`ps cax | egrep nmserver | awk '{print $1;}'`
if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
    echo "Reinitializing nmserver's network portion"
    /bin/kill -USR2 $pid
fi

Note 1: You have to executed the lines under "sh".  I suggest you
save them in a file and type "/bin/sh file".

Note 2: I haven't actually tried this (I don't have another NeXT to
test it on), but I figured out out reading the rc scripts.  Please let
me know the result if you try it.

The only way to get -NXHost to work over PPP is to have an IP address
assigned to your Ethernet port, and have a route to that address
reachable over the PPP.

When you try to -NXHost, it uses UDP, and for some reason the UDP
protocol decides to use the Ethernet's IP address for outgoing
packets, rather than using the PPP's IP address.

You'll also have similar problems trying to get talk to work over
PPP. Unless there is a route to your Ethernet's IP address, it isn't
going to work.
