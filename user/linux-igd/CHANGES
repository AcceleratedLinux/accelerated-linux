  * Fixed interface statistics gathering and streamlined
    into a single function.

  * linux-igd 1.0 released

2006-10-01 Daniel J Blueman <daniel.blueman@gmail.com>
  * Fixed compilation on GCC-2.9x, noticed by Vyacheslav Garashchenko.

  * Use bounded string functions, to protect from overflow exploits/stack-smashing.

2006-08-13 Daniel J Blueman <daniel.blueman@gmail.com>
  * linux-igd 0.95 released

2006-07-25 Daniel J Blueman <daniel.blueman@gmail.com>
  * Added option ALLOW_MULTICAST to init script, which when not
    set to 'no', enables multicast packets to be received by
    internal interface

  * Added '-f' option to run in foreground for debugging etc

  * Validate internal interface name correctly

  * Other minor tweaks, such as making variables local to block
    to save on stack space, interface name length fixes

  * Added manpage contributed by José Fonseca <j_r_fonseca@yahoo.co.uk>

  * Protect against bad addresses being passed to inet_addr()

  * Enable compiler optimization in makefile

  * Fix compile warnings and uninitialised variable possible use

  * Some makefile and code cleanups

  * Updated installation instructions for libupnp 1.3.1, and also
    added a note about installing with precompiled libraries on Fedora
    Core 5.

  * Fixed problem with multiple children being forked when using
    iptables to modify the netfilter tables. upnpd was doing a
    fork+system without a following exit, so children continued living
    on. Now a fork+exec+exit is done.
    
  * Included a patch from Juho Vähä-Herttua to fix inserting of
    forward rules when using libiptc.

  * Added handling of port mapping duration. Port mappings will be
    automatically removed when they expire. If the client doesn't set
    a duration, a default duration can be used. The default duration
    can either be set as a relative time (e.g. two hours), or as an
    absolute time of day (e.g. 04:00 every day).
    
  * You can force upnpd to delete all port mappings by sending it the
    SIGUSR1 signal. The SIGINT and SIGTERM signals terminate upnpd.
    
  * Made parsing of the configuration file more secure by guarding
    against buffer overflow.
    
  * In the configuration file, the path to the iptables command is now
    specified between quotes, to allow all characters to be used in
    the path.
    
  * syslog messages are now sent to local6. Trace output is sent to
    LOG_DEBUG. You can specify the log level in the configuration file
    by setting debug_mode between 0 (no output)  and 3 (all output).
    
  * added an example init.d script: etc/upnpd.rc.
    
  * Some code cleanups, like only defining globals in one place
    (i.e. not in an include file), and some improvements to the
    Makefile.
