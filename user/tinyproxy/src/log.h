/*
 * Okay, I have modelled the levels for logging off the syslog() interface.
 * However, I would really prefer if only five of the levels are used. You
 * can see them below and I'll describe what each level should be for.
 * Hopefully tinyproxy will remain consistent with these levels.
 *	-- rjkaes
 * Sorry but I had to destroy the hope ;-) There was a need to log 
 * connections without the INFO stuff and not to have them as NOTICE.
 *	-- hgb
 *
 * Level	Description
 * -----	-----------
 * LOG_CRIT	This is catastrophic. Basically, tinyproxy can not recover
 *		from this and will either close the child (if we're lucky),
 *		or the entire daemon. I would relegate this to conditions
 *		like unable to create the listening socket, or unable to
 *		create a child. If you're going to log at this level provide
 *		as much information as possible.
 *
 * LOG_ERR	Okay, something bad happened. We can recover from this, but
 *		the connection will be terminated. This should be for things
 *		like when we cannot create a socket, or out of memory.
 *		Basically, the connection will not work, but it's not enough
 *		to bring the whole daemon down.
 *
 * LOG_WARNING	There is condition which will change the behaviour of
 *		tinyproxy from what is expected. For example, somebody did
 *		not specify a port. tinyproxy will handle this (by using
 *		it's default port), but it's a _higher_ level situation
 *		which the admin should be aware of.
 *
 * LOG_NOTICE	This is for a special condition. Nothing has gone wrong, but
 *		it is more important than the common LOG_INFO level. Right
 *		now it is used for actions like creating/destroying children,
 *		unauthorized access, signal handling, etc.
 *
 * LOG_CONN	This additional level is for logging connections only, so 
 *		it is easy to control only the requests in the logfile.
 *		If we log through syslog, this is set to LOG_INFO.
 *			-- hgb
 *
 * LOG_INFO	Everything else ends up here. Logging for incoming
 *		connections, denying due to filtering rules, unable to
 *		connect to remote server, etc.
 *
 * LOG_DEBUG	Don't use this level. :) Use the two DEBUG?() macros
 *		instead since they can remain in the source if needed. (I
 *		don't advocate this, but it could be useful at times.)
