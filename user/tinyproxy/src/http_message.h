 *
 * HTTP Message API
 * ----------------
 * The idea behind this application programming interface (API) is to
 * represent an HTTP response message as a concrete entity.  The API
 * functions allow the message to be built up systematically before
 * transmission to a connected socket.
 *
 * The order of the functions in your program would look something like
 * this:
 *   http_message_create()
 *   http_message_set_response()
 *   http_message_set_body() [optional if no body is required]
 *   http_message_add_headers() [optional if no additional headers are used]
 *   http_message_send()
 *   http_message_destroy()
 *
 * NOTE: No user data is stored in the http_message_t type; therefore,
 * do not delete strings referenced by the http_message_t object
 * before you call http_message_destroy().  By not copying data, the
 * API functions are faster, but you must take greater care.
 *
 * (Side note: be _very_ careful when using stack allocated memory with
 * this API.  Bad things will happen if you try to pass the
 * http_message_t out of the calling function since the stack
 * allocated memory referenced by the http_message_t will no long
 * exist.)
