  tinyproxy is a collaborative work between Steven Young
  <sdyoung@well.com> and Robert James Kaes <rjkaes@flarenet.com>.

  From versions 0-1.1, Steven Young was the primary maintainer.
  From 1.2 to 1.3.0, Robert James Kaes was the primary maintainer.
  As of 1.3.1, Steven Young was once again be the primary maintainer.

  But, Robert James Kaes was again the maintainer starting with 1.4.0.
  Place your bets as to when the maintainer will change again. :) Kidding!
