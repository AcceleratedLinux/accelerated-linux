TODO List
---------

The following are features that I would like to add to tinyproxy in the
future.  Where possible, I've listed the person who suggested it.  This
list is in no particular order.  And hey, if you want to implement one of
these, or another idea you have, go right ahead.  Just mail me the diff
against the current tree and I'll integrate it if possible.

    [ Actually, the ordering has become kind of important as of
      late. Basically, I'm adding new ideas to the bottom of the list
      as I go. ]

 * Include hooks so other types of proxies can be modularly added to
   the source tree.  Then people can simply choose which types of
   proxies (ftp, www, etc) they'd like enabled in tinyproxy.h
   Suggested: Tarun Tuli.

 * Include a function to rewrite the incoming requests.  Should not be
   much of a problem.  Just need to modify the process_method() code
   to look up the URL and rewrite it.  If we want to go really fancy
   with RegEx mapping this could get ugly. :)

 * Have the ability to send the data from the connections through an
   external filtering program.  I kind of like this idea, but I don't
   really have a good way of doing it yet.
   Suggested: Ed Avis

 * Include the ability to rewrite both incoming and outgoing headers.

 * Enable an option for chroot() jailing tinyproxy.

 * Come up with a more consistent (and elegant) way of logging errors
   for the administrators.  Right now it's more a hodge-podge
   collections of error messages without a _real_ standard.  I would
   prefer a more uniform look.

 * Include user authentication for accessing tinyproxy itself.
   Administrators should be allowed to selectively allow certain users
   access to tinyproxy via a user name/password pair.  Check the
   HTTP/1.1 RFC for more information.  [Suggested: Tyrone Tranmer]
