INFO
----
The following files were/are useful for the proper coding of
tinyproxy. Please note: someday tinyproxy will actually be RFC
compliant, but today is not that day. Right now tinyproxy is pretty
close to being HTTP/1.0 compliant, but there are probably a few
incompatibilities kicking around.

RFCs
----
1945	Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0
2396	Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax
2616	Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
2617	HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication

POSSIBLE LOCATION
-----------------
There are many places to obtain a copy of the RFCs, but I use

      http://www.rfc-editor.org/

since it provides a great search feature for finding all the RFCs for
a particular topic.
