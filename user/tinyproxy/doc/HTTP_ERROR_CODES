The following is a list of the response codes for the various states of
the server. Currently I would recommend we stick to the HTTP/1.0 return
codes for our errors. Once we start to support the distinction between
HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 requests from the client, then we can use the
HTTP/1.1 responses.
