#
# Name of the user the tinyproxy daemon should switch to after the port
# has been bound.
#
User nobody
Group nogroup

#
# Port to listen on.
#
Port 8888

#
# If you have multiple interfaces this allows you to bind to only one. If
# this is commented out, tinyproxy will bind to all interfaces present.
#
#Listen 192.168.0.1

#
# The Bind directive allows you to bind the outgoing connections to a
# particular IP address.
#
#Bind 192.168.0.1

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds of inactivity a connection is allowed to
# have before it closed by tinyproxy.
#
Timeout 600

#
# ErrorFile: Defines the HTML file to send when a given HTTP error
# occurs.  You will probably need to customize the location to your
# particular install.  The usual locations to check are:
#   /usr/local/share/tinyproxy
#   /usr/share/tinyproxy
#   /etc/tinyproxy
#
# ErrorFile 404 "/usr/share/tinyproxy/404.html"
# ErrorFile 400 "/usr/share/tinyproxy/400.html"
# ErrorFile 503 "/usr/share/tinyproxy/503.html"
# ErrorFile 403 "/usr/share/tinyproxy/403.html"
# ErrorFile 408 "/usr/share/tinyproxy/408.html"

# 
# DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
# HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
# that has occured.
#
DefaultErrorFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/default.html"

#
# StatFile: The HTML file that gets sent when a request is made
# for the stathost.  If this file doesn't exist a basic page is
# hardcoded in tinyproxy.
#
StatFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/stats.html"

#
# Where to log the information. Either LogFile or Syslog should be set,
# but not both.
#
Logfile "/var/log/tinyproxy.log"
# Syslog On

#
# Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
#	Critical	(least verbose)
#	Error
#	Warning
#	Notice
#	Connect		(to log connections without Info's noise)
#	Info		(most verbose)
# The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the LogLevel
# was set to Warning, than all log messages from Warning to Critical would be
# output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.
#
LogLevel Info

#
# PidFile: Write the PID of the main tinyproxy thread to this file so it
# can be used for signalling purposes.
#
PidFile "/var/run/tinyproxy.pid"

#
# Include the X-Tinyproxy header, which has the client's IP address when
# connecting to the sites listed.
#
#XTinyproxy mydomain.com

#
# Turns on upstream proxy support.
#
# The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
# based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.
#
# For example:
#  # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".test.domain.invalid"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".our_testbed.example.com"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"
#
#  # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
#  no upstream ".internal.example.com"
#  no upstream "www.example.com"
#  no upstream "10.0.0.0/8"
#  no upstream "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
#  no upstream "."
#
#  # connection to these boxes go through their DMZ firewalls
#  upstream cust1_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust1"
#  upstream cust2_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust2"
#
#  # default upstream is internet firewall
#  upstream firewall.internal.example.com:80
#
# The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
# can use a host, or a domain:
#  name     matches host exactly
#  .name    matches any host in domain "name"
#  .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
#  IP/bits  matches network/mask
#  IP/mask  matches network/mask
#
#Upstream some.remote.proxy:port

#
# This is the absolute highest number of threads which will be created. In
# other words, only MaxClients number of clients can be connected at the
# same time.
#
MaxClients 100

#
# These settings set the upper and lower limit for the number of
# spare servers which should be available. If the number of spare servers
# falls below MinSpareServers then new ones will be created. If the number
# of servers exceeds MaxSpareServers then the extras will be killed off.
#
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 20

#
# Number of servers to start initially.
#
StartServers 10

#
# MaxRequestsPerChild is the number of connections a thread will handle
# before it is killed. In practise this should be set to 0, which disables
# thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory leakage, then set
# this to something like 10000
#
MaxRequestsPerChild 0

#
# The following is the authorization controls. If there are any access
# control keywords then the default action is to DENY. Otherwise, the
# default action is ALLOW.
#
# Also the order of the controls are important. The incoming connections
# are tested against the controls based on order.
#
Allow 127.0.0.1
Allow 192.168.1.0/25

#
# The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using the real host name
# is a security concern.  If the following directive is enabled, the string
# supplied will be used as the host name in the Via header; otherwise, the
# server's host name will be used.
#
ViaProxyName "tinyproxy"

#
# The location of the filter file.
#
#Filter "/etc/tinyproxy/filter"

# Filter based on URLs rather than domains.

#FilterURLs On

# Use POSIX Extended regular expressions rather than basic.

#FilterCaseSensitive On     

#
# Change the default policy of the filtering system.  If this directive is
# commented out, or is set to "No" then the default policy is to allow
# everything which is not specifically denied by the filter file.
#
# However, by setting this directive to "Yes" the default policy becomes to
# deny everything which is _not_ specifically allowed by the filter file.
#
#FilterDefaultDeny Yes

#
# If an Anonymous keyword is present, then anonymous proxying is enabled.
# The headers listed are allowed through, while all others are denied. If
# no Anonymous keyword is present, then all header are allowed through.
# You must include quotes around the headers.
#
#Anonymous "Host"
#Anonymous "Authorization"

#
# This is a list of ports allowed by tinyproxy when the CONNECT method
# is used.  To disable the CONNECT method altogether, set the value to 0.
# If no ConnectPort line is found, all ports are allowed (which is not
# very secure.)
#
# The following two ports are used by SSL.
#
ConnectPort 443
ConnectPort 563
