<h1>RSyslog - Features</h1>
<p><b>This page lists both current features as well as
those being considered for future versions of rsyslog.</b> If you
think a feature is missing, drop
<a href="mailto:rgerhards@adiscon.com">Rainer</a> a
note. Rsyslog is a vital project. Features are added each few days. If
you would like to keep up of what is going on, you can also subscribe
to the <a href="http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog">rsyslog
mailing list</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A better
structured feature list is now contained in our </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="rsyslog_ng_comparison.html">rsyslog
vs. syslog-ng comparison</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">.
</span>Probably that page will replace this one&nbsp;in the
future.
</p>
<h2>Current Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>native support for <a href="rsyslog_mysql.html">writing
to MySQL databases</a></li>
<li> native support for writing to Postgres databases</li>
<li>direct support for Firebird/Interbase,
OpenTDS (MS SQL, Sybase), SQLLite, Ingres, Oracle, and mSQL via libdbi,
a database abstraction layer (almost as good as native)</li>
<li>support for (plain) tcp based syslog - much better
reliability</li>
<li>support for sending and receiving compressed syslog messages</li>
<li>support for on-demand on-disk spooling of messages that can
not be processed fast enough (a great feature for <a href="rsyslog_high_database_rate.html">writing massive
amounts of syslog messages to a database</a>)</li>
<li>ability to monitor text files and convert their contents
into syslog messages (one per line)</li>
<li>ability to configure backup syslog/database servers - if
the primary fails, control is switched to a prioritized list of backups</li>
<li>support for receiving messages via reliable <a href="http://www.monitorware.com/Common/en/glossary/rfc3195.php">
RFC 3195</a> delivery</li>
<li>ability to generate file names and directories (log
targets) dynamically, based on many different properties</li>
<li>control of log output format, including ability to present
channel and priority as visible log data</li>
<li>good timestamp format control; at a minimum, ISO 8601/RFC
3339 second-resolution UTC zone</li>
<li>ability to reformat message contents and work with
substrings</li>
<li>support for log files larger than 2gb</li>
<li>support for file size limitation and automatic rollover
command execution</li>
<li>support for running multiple rsyslogd instances on a single
machine</li>
<li>support for <a href="rsyslog_stunnel.html">
ssl-protected syslog</a> (via stunnel)</li>
<li>ability to filter on any part of the message, not just
facility and severity</li>
<li>ability to use regular expressions in filters</li>
<li>support for discarding messages based on filters</li>
<li>ability to execute shell scripts on received messages</li>
<li>control of whether the local hostname or the hostname of
the origin of the data is shown as the hostname in the output</li>
<li>ability to preserve the original hostname in NAT
environments and relay chains </li>
<li>ability to limit the allowed network senders</li>
<li>powerful BSD-style hostname and program name blocks for
easy multi-host support</li>
<li> massively multi-threaded with dynamic work thread pools
that start up and shut themselves down on an as-needed basis (great for
high log volume on multicore machines)</li>
<li>very experimental and volatile support for <a href="syslog-protocol.html">syslog-protocol</a>
compliant messages (it is volatile because standardization is currently
underway and this is a proof-of-concept implementation to aid this
effort)</li>
<li> experimental support for syslog-transport-tls based
framing on syslog/tcp connections</li>
<li> the sysklogd's klogd functionality is implemented as the <i>imklog</i>
input plug-in. So rsyslog is a full replacement for the sysklogd package</li>
<li> support for IPv6</li>
<li> ability to control repeated line reduction ("last message
repeated n times") on a per selector-line basis</li>
<li> supports sub-configuration files, which can be
automatically read from directories. Includes are specified in the main
configuration file</li>
<li> supports multiple actions per selector/filter condition</li>
<li> MySQL and Postgres SQL functionality as a dynamically
loadable plug-in</li>
<li> modular design for inputs and outputs - easily extensible
via custom plugins</li>
<li> an easy-to-write to plugin interface</li>
<li> ability to send SNMP trap messages</li>
<li>support for arbitrary complex boolean, string and
arithmetic expressions in message filters</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
<p>The list below is something like a repository of ideas we'd
like to implement. Features on this list are typically NOT scheduled
for immediate inclusion. We maintain a
<a href="http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/rsyslog-feature.html">feature
request tracker at our bugzilla</a>. This tracker has things
typically within reach of implementation. Users are encouraged to
submit feature requests there (or via our forums). If we like them but
they look quite long-lived (aka "not soon to be implemented"), they
will possibly be migrated to this list here and at some time moved back
to the sourceforge tracker.</p>
<ul>
<li>implement native email-functionality in selector (probably
best done as a plug-in)</li>
<li>port it to more *nix variants (eg AIX and HP UX) - this
needs volunteers with access to those machines and knowledge </li>
<li>support for native SSL enryption of plain tcp syslog
sessions. This will most probably happen based on syslog-transport-tls.</li>
<li>pcre filtering - maybe (depending on feedback)&nbsp; -
simple regex already partly added. So far, this seems sufficient so
that there is no urgent need to do pcre</li>
<li>support for <a href="http://www.monitorware.com/Common/en/glossary/rfc3195.php">RFC
3195</a> as a sender - this is currently unlikely to happen,
because there is no real demand for it. Any work on RFC 3195 has been
suspend until we see some real interest in it.&nbsp; It is probably
much better to use TCP-based syslog, which is interoperable with a
large number of applications. You may also read my blog post on the
future of liblogging, which contains interesting information about the <a href="http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/09/where-is-liblogging-heading-to.html">
future of RFC 3195 in rsyslog</a>.</li>
