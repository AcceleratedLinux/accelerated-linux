<h1>The Property Replacer</h1>
<p><b>The property replacer is a core component in
rsyslogd's output system.</b> A syslog message has a number of
well-defined properties (see below). Each of this properties can be
accessed <b>and</b> manipulated by the property replacer.
With it, it is easy to use only part of a property value or manipulate
the value, e.g. by converting all characters to lower case.</p>
<h1>Accessing Properties</h1>
<p>Syslog message properties are used inside templates. They are
accessed by putting them between percent signs. Properties can be
modified by the property replacer. The full syntax is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><b><code>%propname:fromChar:toChar:options%</code></b></blockquote>
<h2>Available Properties</h2>
<p><b><code>propname</code></b> is the
name of the property to access. It is case-sensitive.
Currently supported are:</p>

<p>Properties starting with a $-sign are so-called system
properties. These do NOT stem from the message but are rather
internally-generated.</p>
<h2>Character Positions</h2>
<p><b><code>FromChar</code></b> and <b><code>toChar</code></b>
are used to build substrings. They specify the offset within the string
that should be copied. Offset counting starts at 1, so if you need to
obtain the first 2 characters of the message text, you can use this
syntax: "%msg:1:2%". If you do not whish to specify from and to, but
you want to specify options, you still need to include the colons. For
example, if you would like to convert the full message text to lower
case, use "%msg:::lowercase%". If you would like to extract from a
position until the end of the string, you can place a dollar-sign ("$")
in toChar (e.g. %msg:10:$%, which will extract from position 10 to the
end of the string).</p>
<p>There is also support for <b>regular expressions</b>.
To use them, you need to place a "R" into FromChar. This tells rsyslog
that a regular expression instead of position-based extraction is
desired. The actual regular expression must then be provided in toChar.
The regular expression <b>must</b> be followed by the
string "--end". It denotes the end of the regular expression and will
not become part of it. If you are using regular expressions, the
property replacer will return the part of the property text that
matches the regular expression. An example for a property replacer
sequence with a regular expression is: "%msg:R:.*Sev:. \(.*\)
\[.*--end%"<br>
</p>
<p><b>Also, extraction can be done based on so-called
"fields"</b>. To do so, place a "F" into FromChar. A field in its
current definition is anything that is delimited by a delimiter
character. The delimiter by default is TAB (US-ASCII value 9). However,
if can be changed to any other US-ASCII character by specifying a comma
and the <b>decimal</b> US-ASCII value of the delimiter
immediately after the "F". For example, to use comma (",") as a
delimiter, use this field specifier: "F,44".&nbsp; If your syslog
data is delimited, this is a quicker way to extract than via regular
expressions (actually, a *much* quicker way). Field counting starts at
1. Field zero is accepted, but will always lead to a "field not found"
error. The same happens if a field number higher than the number of
fields in the property is requested. The field number must be placed in
the "ToChar" parameter. An example where the 3rd field (delimited by
TAB) from the msg property is extracted is as follows: "%msg:F:3%". The
same example with semicolon as delimiter is "%msg:F,59:3%".</p>
<p>Please note that the special characters "F" and "R" are
case-sensitive. Only upper case works, lower case will return an error.
There are no white spaces permitted inside the sequence (that will lead
to error messages and will NOT provide the intended result).<br>

<h2>Property Options</h2>
<b><code>property options</code></b> are
case-insensitive. Currently, the following options are defined:
<p></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>uppercase</b></td>
<td>convert property to lowercase only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>lowercase</b></td>
<td>convert property text to uppercase only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>drop-last-lf</b></td>
<td>The last LF in the message (if any), is dropped.
Especially useful for PIX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>date-mysql</b></td>
<td>format as mysql date</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>date-rfc3164</b></td>
<td>format as RFC 3164 date</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>date-rfc3339</b></td>
<td>format as RFC 3339 date</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>escape-cc</b></td>
<td>replace control characters (ASCII value 127 and values
less then 32) with an escape sequence. The sequnce is
"#&lt;charval&gt;" where charval is the 3-digit decimal value
of the control character. For example, a tabulator would be replaced by
"#009".<br>
Note: using this option requires that <a href="rsconf1_escapecontrolcharactersonreceive.html">$EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive</a>
is set to off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>space-cc</b></td>
<td>replace control characters by spaces<br>
Note: using this option requires that <a href="rsconf1_escapecontrolcharactersonreceive.html">$EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive</a>
is set to off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>drop-cc</b></td>
<td>drop control characters - the resulting string will
neither contain control characters, escape sequences nor any other
replacement character like space.<br>
Note: using this option requires that <a href="rsconf1_escapecontrolcharactersonreceive.html">$EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive</a>
is set to off.</td>
</tr>
