<h2>$ActionExecOnlyWhenPreviousIsSuspended</h2>
<p><b>Type:</b> global configuration directive</p>
<p><b>Default:</b> off</p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>This directive allows to specify if actions should always be executed ("off," the default) or only if the previous action is suspended ("on"). This directive works hand-in-hand with the multiple actions per selector feature. It can be used, for example, to create rules that automatically switch destination servers or databases to a (set of) backup(s), if the primary server fails. Note that this feature depends on proper implementation of the suspend feature in the output module. All built-in output modules properly support it (most importantly the database write and the syslog message forwarder).</p>
<p>This selector processes all messages it receives (*.*).  It tries to forward every message to primary-syslog.example.com (via tcp). If it can not reach that server, it tries secondary-1-syslog.example.com, if that fails too, it tries secondary-2-syslog.example.com. If neither of these servers can be connected, the data is stored in /var/log/localbuffer. Please note that the secondaries and the local log buffer are only used if the one before them does not work. So ideally, /var/log/localbuffer will never receive a message. If one of the servers resumes operation, it automatically takes over processing again.</p>
<p>We strongly advise not to use repeated line reduction together with ActionExecOnlyIfPreviousIsSuspended. It may lead to "interesting" and undesired results (but you can try it if you like).</p>
