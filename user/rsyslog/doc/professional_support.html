<p>Creating rsyslog config files is easy - but if you would like
to have that extra feature and have no time to do it, this service is
for you. Important: BEFORE you purchase this service, contact us and
inquire (via <a href="mailto:info%40adiscon.com">info@adiscon.com</a>)
whether or not your desired result can be achieved via rsyslog. Once
this is clear, order the service and we will ship a custom-made
configuration file within 5 working days (at latest, most often much
faster). For security reasons, we will not put passwords into the
configuration file, but will place easy to read comments in the places
where you need to put them in. The agreement is governed under German
law. You may also purchase this service if you would like to have your
own configuration file reviewed, e.g. for auditing purposes.</p><br><p>All agreements are
governed under German law.
