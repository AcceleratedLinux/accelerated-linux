<h1>Using php-syslog-ng with rsyslog</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i><b>In this paper, I describe how to use
<a href="http://www.vermeer.org/projects/php-syslog-ng">php-syslog-ng</a> with
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">rsyslogd</a>. </b>&nbsp;Php-syslog-ng is a 
popular web interface to syslog data. Its name stem from the fact that it 
usually picks up its data from a database created by
<a href="http://www.balabit.com/products/syslog_ng/">syslog-ng</a> and some 
helper scripts. However, there is nothing syslog-ng specific in the database. 
With rsyslogd's high customizability, it is easy to write to a syslog-ng like 
schema. I will tell you how to do this, enabling you to use php-syslog-ng as a 
front-end for rsyslogd - or save the hassle with syslog-ng database 
configuration and simply go ahead and use rsyslogd instead.</i></p>
<h2>Overall System Setup</h2>
<p>The setup is pretty straightforward. Basically, php-syslog-ng's interface to 
the syslogd is the database. We use the schema that php-syslog-ng expects and 
make rsyslogd write to it in its format. Because of this, php-syslog-ng does not 
even know there is no syslog-ng present.</p>
<h2>Setting up the system</h2>
<p>For php-syslog-ng, you can follow its usual setup instructions. Just skip any 
steps refering to configure syslog-ng. Make sure you create the database schema 
in <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. As of this writing, the expected schema can be created via this script:</p>
<blockquote>
	<code>CREATE DATABASE syslog<br>
	!<br>
	USE syslog<br>
	!<br>
	CREATE TABLE logs (<br>
	host varchar(32) default NULL,<br>
	facility varchar(10) default NULL,<br>
	priority varchar(10) default NULL,<br>
	level varchar(10) default NULL,<br>
	tag varchar(10) default NULL,<br>
	date date default NULL,<br>
	time time default NULL,<br>
	program varchar(15) default NULL,<br>
	msg text,<br>
	seq int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,<br>
	PRIMARY KEY (seq),<br>
	KEY host (host),<br>
	KEY seq (seq),<br>
	KEY program (program),<br>
	KEY time (time),<br>
	KEY date (date),<br>
	KEY priority (priority),<br>
	KEY facility (facility)<br>
	) TYPE=MyISAM;</code>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note that at the time you are reading this paper, the schema might have changed. 
Check for any differences. As we customize rsyslogd to the schema, it is vital 
to have the correct one. If this paper is outdated,
<a href="mailto:rgerhards@adiscon.com">let me know</a> so that I can fix it.</p>
<p>Once this schema is created, we simply instruct rsyslogd to store received 
data in it. I wont go into too much detail here. If you are interested in some 
more details, you might find my paper &quot;<a href="rsyslog_mysql.html">Writing 
syslog messages to MySQL</a>&quot; worth reading. For this article, we simply modify
<a href="rsyslog_conf.html">rsyslog.conf </a>so that it writes to the database. 
That is easy. Just these two lines are needed:</p>
<blockquote>
	<code><font color="green">$template syslog-ng,&quot;insert into logs(host, facility, priority, tag, date, 
	time, msg) values ('%HOSTNAME%', %syslogfacility%, %syslogpriority%, 
	'%syslogtag%',&nbsp; '%timereported:::date-mysql%', '%timereported:::date-mysql%', 
	'%msg%')&quot;, SQL</font> <br>
	<font color="red">*.*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;mysql-server,syslog,user,pass;syslog-ng</font>
	</code>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just <b>two</b> lines. I have color-coded them so that you see what 
belongs together (the colors have no other meaning). The green line is the 
actual SQL statement being used to take care of the syslog-ng schema. Rsyslogd 
allows you to fully control the statement sent to the database. This allows you 
to write to any database format, including your homegrown one (if you so desire). 
Please note that there is a small inefficiency in our current usage: the
	<code><font color="green">'%timereported:::date-mysql%'</font></code>&nbsp; 
property is used for both the time and the date (if you wonder about what all 
these funny characters mean, see the <a href="property_replacer.html">rsyslogd 
property replacer manual</a>) . We could have extracted just the date and time 
parts of the respective properties. However, this is more complicated and also 
adds processing time to rsyslogd's processing (substrings must be extracted). So we take a full mysql-formatted timestamp and supply it to MySQL. The sql engine in turn 
discards the unneeded part. It works pretty well. As of my understanding, the 
inefficiency of discarding the unneeded part in MySQL is lower than the 
effciency gain from using the full timestamp in rsyslogd. So it is most probably 
the best solution.</p>
<p>Please note that rsyslogd knows two different timestamp properties: one is 
timereported, used here. It is the timestamp from the message itself. Sometimes 
that is a good choice, in other cases not. It depends on your environment. The other one is the timegenerated 
property. This is the time when rsyslogd received the message. For obvious 
reasons, that timestamp is consistent, even when your devices are in multiple 
time zones or their clocks are off. However, it is not &quot;the real thing&quot;. It's 
your choice which one you prefer. If you prefer timegenerated ... simply use it 
;)</p>
<p>The line in red tells rsyslogd which messages to log and where to store it. 
The &quot;*.*&quot; selects all messages. You can use standard syslog selector line filters here if 
you do not like to see everything in your database. The &quot;&gt;&quot; tells 
rsyslogd that a MySQL connection 
must be established. Then, &quot;mysql-server&quot; is the name or IP address of the 
server machine, &quot;syslog&quot; is the database name (default from the schema) and &quot;user&quot; 
and &quot;pass&quot; are the logon credentials. Use a user with low privileges, insert into the 
logs table is sufficient. &quot;syslog-ng&quot; is the template name and tells rsyslogd to 
use the SQL statement shown above.</p>
<p>Once you have made the changes, all you need to do is reload (or HUP) 
rsyslogd. Then, you should see syslog messages flow into your database - and 
show up in php-syslog-ng.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<P>With minumal effort, you can use php-syslog-ng together with rsyslogd. For 
those unfamiliar with syslog-ng, this configuration is probably easier to set up 
then switching to syslog-ng. For existing rsyslogd users, php-syslog-ng might be a nice 
add-on to their logging infrastructure.</P>
<P>Please note that the <a href="http://www.monitorware.com/en/">MonitorWare family</a> (to which rsyslog belongs) also 
offers a web-interface: <a href="http://www.phplogcon.org/">phpLogCon</a>. At the time of this writing, phpLogCon's code 
is by far not as clean as I would like it to be. Also the user-interface is 
definitely not as intutive as pp-syslog-ng. From a functionality point of view, 
however, I think it already is a bit ahead. So you might 
consider using it. I have set up a <a href="http://demo.rsyslog.com/">demo server</a>., 
You can have a peek at it 
without installing anything.</P>
