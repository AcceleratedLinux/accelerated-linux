<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In theory, modules provide input and output, among other functions, in 
rsyslog. In practice, modules are only utilized for output in the current 
release. The module interface is not yet completed and a moving target. We do 
not recommend to write a module based on the current specification. If you do, 
please be prepared that future released of rsyslog will probably break your 
module. </p>
<p>A goal of modularization is to provide an easy to use plug-in interface. 
However, this goal is not yet reached and all modules must be statically linked.</p>
<h2>Module &quot;generation&quot;</h2>
<p>There is a lot of plumbing that is always the same in all modules. For 
example, the interface definitions, answering function pointer queries and such. 
To get rid of these laborious things, I generate most of them automatically from 
a single file. This file is named module-template.h. It also contains the 
current best description of the interface &quot;specification&quot;.</p>
<p>One thing that can also be achieved with it is the capability to cope with a 
rapidly changing interface specification. The module interface is evolving. 
Currently, it is far from being finished. As I moved the monolithic code to 
modules, I needed (and still need) to make many &quot;non-clean&quot; code hacks, just to 
get it working. These things are now gradually being removed. However, this 
requires frequent changes to the interfaces, as things move in and out while 
working towards a clean interface. All the interim is necessary to reach the 
goal. This volatility of specifications is the number one reasons I currently 
advise against implementing your own modules (hint: if you do, be sure to use 
module-template.h and be prepared to fix newly appearing and disappearing data 
elements).</p>
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<h3>Source</h3>
<p>Output modules, and only output modules, should start with a file name of 
&quot;om&quot; (e.g. &quot;omfile.c&quot;, &quot;omshell.c&quot;). Similarly, input modules will use &quot;im&quot; and 
filter modules &quot;fm&quot;. The third character shall not be a hyphen.</p>
<h2>Module Security</h2>
<p>Modules are directly loaded into rsyslog's address space. As such, any module 
is provided a big level of trust. Please note that further module interfaces 
might provide a way to load a module into an isolated address space. This, 
however, is far from being completed. So the number one rule about module 
security is to run only code that you know you can trust.</p>
<p>To minimize the security risks associated with modules, rsyslog provides only 
the most minimalistic access to data structures to its modules. For that reason, 
the output modules do not receive any direct pointers to the selector_t 
structure, the syslogd action structures and - most importantly - the msg 
structure itself. Access to these structures would enable modules to access data 
that is none of their business, creating a potential security weakness.</p>
<p>Not having access to these structures also simplifies further queueing and 
error handling cases. As we do not need to provide e.g. full access to the msg 
object itself, we do not need to serialize and cache it. Instead, strings needed 
by the module are created by syslogd and then the final result is provided to 
the module. That, for example, means that in a queued case $NOW is the actual 
timestamp of when the message was processed, which may be even days before it 
being dequeued. Think about it: If we wouldn't cache the resulting string, $NOW 
would be the actual date if the action were suspended and messages queued for 
some time. That could potentially result in big confusion.</p>
<p>It is thought that if an output module actually needs access to the while msg 
object, we will (then) introduce a way to serialize it (e.g. to XML) in the 
property replacer. Then, the output module can work with this serialized object. 
The key point is that output modules never deal directly with msg objects (and 
other internal structures). Besides security, this also greatly simplifies the 
job of the output module developer.</p>
<h2>Action Selectors</h2>
<p>Modules (and rsyslog) need to know when they are called. For this, there must 
a an action identification in selector lines. There are two syntaxes: the 
single-character syntax, where a single characters identifies a module (e.g. &quot;*&quot; 
for a wall message) and the modules designator syntax, where the module name is 
given between colons (e.g. &quot;:ommysql:&quot;). The single character syntax is 
depreciated and should not be used for new plugins.</p>
