<h1>rsyslog bugs and annoyances</h1>
<p><b>This page lists the known bugs rsyslog has to offer.</b>&nbsp; It lists 
old and esoteric bugs. A live list of bugs is contained in our bugzilla. <b>
<font color="#FF0000">Please visit </font><a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/bugs">
<font color="#FF0000">http://www.rsyslog.com/bugs</font></a></b> to see what we 
have. There, you can also open your own bug report if you think you found one.</p>
<p>This list has last been updated on 2008-02-12 by

<h1>rsyslogd</h1>
<h2>EQUALLY-NAMED TEMPLATES</h2>
<p>If multiple templates with the SAME name are created, all but the
   first definition is IGNORED. So you can NOT (yet) replace a
   template definition. I also strongly doubt I will ever support this, because 
it does not make an awful lot of sense (after all, why not use two template 
names...).</p>
<h2>WALLMSG FORMAT (* selector)
   </h2>
<p>This format is actually not 100% compatible with stock syslogd - the
   date is missing. Will be fixed soon and can also be fixed just via
   the proper template. Anyone up for this? ;)</p>
<h2>MULTIPLE INSTANCES</h2>
<p>If multiple instances are running on a single machine, the one with
  the -r switch must start first. Also, UDP-based syslog forwarding between the 
instances does not work. Use TCP instead.</p>
