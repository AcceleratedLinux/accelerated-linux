<h2>Contributor Hall of Fame</h2>
<p><b>This page is dedicated to all the people who helped make
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">rsyslog</a> become a reality.</b> 
Unfortunately, I have begun this page in July of 2007, long after the project 
started. I try to extract all past contributor information from CVS, readme's, 
code etc - but I may fail. If you contributed and do not find yourself listed 
below, please accept my sincere apologies and drop me a line.</p>
<p>Please also note that I will do the checks for past contributors once the 
current very busy development phase is over, so it may take a few weeks to fully 
populate this file.</p>
<p>Contributors are listed in alphabetical order. If I know an Alias only, that 
alias is used as heading. Else the real name is used. If I know first and last 
name, they are listed in that order (&quot;Rainer Gerhards&quot; and not &quot;Gerhards, 
Rainer&quot;). I tend to be sparse with information on contributors, at least without 
their permission. If you contribute, let me know if I may include your email 
and/or web page address.</p>
<p>Thanks to all past, present and future contributors!</p>
