/* tcpsyslog.c
 * This is the implementation of TCP-based syslog. It includes those
 * (few) things that both clients and servers need.
 *
 * File begun on 2007-07-20 by RGerhards (extracted from syslogd.c)
 * This file is under development and has not yet arrived at being fully
 * self-contained and a real object. So far, it is mostly an excerpt
 * of the "old" message code without any modifications. However, it
 * helps to have things at the right place one we go to the meat of it.
