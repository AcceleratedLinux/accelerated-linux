---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.16.1 (rgerhards), 2008-05-02
- fixed a bug in imklog which lead to startup problems (including
  segfault) on some platforms under some circumsances. Thanks to
  Vieri for reporting this bug and helping to troubleshoot it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.16.0 (rgerhards), 2008-04-24
- new v3-stable (3.16.x) based on beta 3.15.x (RELP support)
- bugfix: omsnmp had a too-small sized buffer for hostname+port. This
  could not lead to a segfault, as snprintf() was used, but could cause
  some trouble with extensively long hostnames.
- applied patch from Tiziano MÃ¼ller to remove some compiler warnings
- added gssapi overview/howto thanks to Peter Vrabec
- changed some files to grant LGPLv3 extended persmissions on top of GPLv3
  this also is the first sign of something that will evolve into a
  well-defined "rsyslog runtime library"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.15.1 (rgerhards), 2008-04-11
- bugfix: some messages were emited without hostname
- disabled atomic operations for the time being because they introduce some
  cross-platform trouble - need to see how to fix this in the best 
  possible way
- bugfix: zero-length strings were not supported in object
  deserializer
- added librelp check via PKG_CHECK thanks to Michael Biebl's patch
- file relputil.c deleted, is not actually needed
- added more meaningful error messages to rsyslogd (when some errors
  happens during startup)
- bugfix: memory leaks in script engine
- bugfix: $hostname and $fromhost in RainerScript did not work
This release also includes all changes applied to the stable versions
up to today.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.15.0 (rgerhards), 2008-04-01
- major new feature: imrelp/omrelp support reliable delivery of syslog
  messages via the RELP protocol and librelp (http://www.librelp.com).
  Plain tcp syslog, so far the best reliability solution, can lose
  messages when something goes wrong or a peer goes down. With RELP,
  this can no longer happen. See imrelp.html for more details.
- bugfix: rsyslogd was no longer build by default; man pages are 
  only installed if corresponding option is selected. Thanks to
  Michael Biebl for pointing these problems out.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.14.2 (rgerhards), 2008-04-09
- bugfix: segfault with expression-based filters
- bugfix: omsnmp did not deref errmsg object on exit (no bad effects caused)
- some cleanup
- bugfix: imklog did not work well with kernel 2.6+. Thanks to Peter
  Vrabec for patching it based on the development in sysklogd - and thanks
  to the sysklogd project for upgrading klogd to support the new
  functionality
- some cleanup in imklog
- bugfix: potential segfault in imklog when kernel is compiled without
  /proc/kallsyms and the file System.map is missing. Thanks to
  Andrea Morandi for pointing it out and suggesting a fix.
- bugfixes, credits to varmojfekoj:
  * reset errno before printing a warning message
  * misspelled directive name in code processing legacy options
- bugfix: some legacy options not correctly interpreted - thanks to
  varmojfekoj for the patch
- improved detection of modules being loaded more than once
  thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.14.1 (rgerhards), 2008-04-04
- bugfix: some messages were emited without hostname
- bugfix: rsyslogd was no longer build by default; man pages are 
  only installed if corresponding option is selected. Thanks to
  Michael Biebl for pointing these problems out.
- bugfix: zero-length strings were not supported in object
  deserializer
- disabled atomic operations for this stable build as it caused
  platform problems
- bugfix: memory leaks in script engine
- bugfix: $hostname and $fromhost in RainerScript did not work
- bugfix: some memory leak when queue is runing in disk mode
- man pages improved thanks to varmofekoj and Peter Vrabec
- We have removed the 32 character size limit (from RFC3164) on the
  tag. This had bad effects on existing envrionments, as sysklogd didn't
  obey it either (probably another bug in RFC3164...). We now receive
  the full size, but will modify the outputs so that only 32 characters
  max are used by default. If you need large tags in the output, you need
  to provide custom templates.
- bugfix: some memory leak when queue is runing in disk mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.14.0 (rgerhards), 2008-04-02
An interim version was accidently released to the web. It was named 3.14.0.
To avoid confusion, we have not assigned this version number to any
official release. If you happen to use 3.14.0, please update to 3.14.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.13.0-dev0 (rgerhards), 2008-03-31
- bugfix: accidently set debug option in 3.12.5 reset to production
  This option prevented dlclose() to be called. It had no real bad effects,
  as the modules were otherwise correctly deinitialized and dlopen()
  supports multiple opens of the same module without any memory footprint.
- removed --enable-mudflap, added --enable-valgrind ./configure setting
- bugfix: tcp receiver could segfault due to uninitialized variable
- docfix: queue doc had a wrong directive name that prevented max worker
  threads to be correctly set
- worked a bit on atomic memory operations to support problem-free
  threading (only at non-intrusive places)
- added a --enable/disable-rsyslogd configure option so that
  source-based packaging systems can build plugins without the need
  to compile rsyslogd
- some cleanup
- test of potential new version number scheme
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.12.5 (rgerhards), 2008-03-28
- changed default for "last message repeated n times", which is now
  off by default
- implemented backward compatibility commandline option parsing
- automatically generated compatibility config lines are now also
  logged so that a user can diagnose problems with them
- added compatibility mode for -a, -o and -p options
- compatibility mode processing finished
- changed default file output format to include high-precision timestamps
- added a buid-in template for previous syslogd file format
- added new $ActionFileDefaultTemplate directive
- added support for high-precision timestamps when receiving legacy
  syslog messages
- added new $ActionForwardDefaultTemplate directive
- added new $ActionGSSForwardDefaultTemplate directive
- added build-in templates for easier configuration
- bugfix: fixed small memory leak in tcpclt.c
- bugfix: fixed small memory leak in template regular expressions
- bugfix: regular expressions inside property replacer did not work
  properly
- bugfix: QHOUR and HHOUR properties were wrongly calculated
- bugfix: fixed memory leaks in stream class and imfile
- bugfix: $ModDir did invalid bounds checking, potential overlow in
  dbgprintf() - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- bugfix: -t and -g legacy options max number of sessions had a wrong
  and much too high value
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.12.4 (rgerhards), 2008-03-25
- Greatly enhanced rsyslogd's file write performance by disabling
  file syncing capability of output modules by default. This
  feature is usually not required, not useful and an extreme performance
  hit (both to rsyslogd as well as the system at large). Unfortunately,
  most users enable it by default, because it was most intuitive to enable
  it in plain old sysklogd syslog.conf format. There is now the
  $ActionFileEnableSync config setting which must be enabled in order to
  support syncing. By default it is off. So even if the old-format config
  lines request syncing, it is not done unless explicitely enabled. I am
  sure this is a very useful change and not a risk at all. I need to think
  if I undo it under compatibility mode, but currently this does not
  happen (I fear a lot of lazy users will run rsyslogd in compatibility
  mode, again bringing up this performance problem...).
- added flow control options to other input sources
- added $HHOUR and $QHOUR system properties - can be used for half- and
  quarter-hour logfile rotation
- changed queue's discard severities default value to 8 (do not discard)
  to prevent unintentional message loss
- removed a no-longer needed callback from the output module 
  interface. Results in reduced code complexity.
- bugfix/doc: removed no longer supported -h option from man page
- bugfix: imklog leaked several hundered KB on each HUP. Thanks to
  varmojfekoj for the patch
- bugfix: potential segfault on module unload. Thanks to varmojfekoj for
  the patch
- bugfix: fixed some minor memory leaks
- bugfix: fixed some slightly invalid memory accesses
- bugfix: internally generated messages had "FROMHOST" property not set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.12.3 (rgerhards), 2008-03-18
- added advanced flow control for congestion cases (mode depending on message
  source and its capablity to be delayed without bad side effects)
- bugfix: $ModDir should not be reset on $ResetConfig - this can cause a lot
  of confusion and there is no real good reason to do so. Also conflicts with
  the new -M option and environment setting.
- bugfix: TCP and GSSAPI framing mode variable was uninitialized, leading to
  wrong framing (caused, among others, interop problems)
- bugfix: TCP (and GSSAPI) octet-counted frame did not work correctly in all
  situations. If the header was split across two packet reads, it was invalidly
  processed, causing loss or modification of messages.
- bugfix: memory leak in imfile
- bugfix: duplicate public symbol in omfwd and omgssapi could lead to
  segfault. thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch.
- bugfix: rsyslogd aborted on sigup - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- some more internal cleanup ;)
- begun relp modules, but these are not functional yet
- Greatly enhanced rsyslogd's file write performance by disabling
  file syncing capability of output modules by default. This
  feature is usually not required, not useful and an extreme performance
  hit (both to rsyslogd as well as the system at large). Unfortunately,
  most users enable it by default, because it was most intuitive to enable
  it in plain old sysklogd syslog.conf format. There is now a new config
  setting which must be enabled in order to support syncing. By default it
  is off. So even if the old-format config lines request syncing, it is
  not done unless explicitely enabled. I am sure this is a very useful
  change and not a risk at all. I need to think if I undo it under
  compatibility mode, but currently this does not happen (I fear a lot of
  lazy users will run rsyslogd in compatibility mode, again bringing up
  this performance problem...).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.12.2 (rgerhards), 2008-03-13
- added RSYSLOGD_MODDIR environment variable
- added -M rsyslogd option (allows to specify module directory location)
- converted net.c into a loadable library plugin
- bugfix: debug module now survives unload of loadable module when
  printing out function call data
- bugfix: not properly initialized data could cause several segfaults if
  there were errors in the config file - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- bugfix: rsyslogd segfaulted when imfile read an empty line - thanks
  to Johnny Tan for an excellent bug report
- implemented dynamic module unload capability (not visible to end user)
- some more internal cleanup
- bugfix: imgssapi segfaulted under some conditions; this fix is actually
  not just a fix but a change in the object model. Thanks to varmojfekoj
  for providing the bug report, an initial fix and lots of good discussion
  that lead to where we finally ended up.
- improved session recovery when outbound tcp connection breaks, reduces
  probability of message loss at the price of a highly unlikely potential
  (single) message duplication
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.12.1 (rgerhards), 2008-03-06
- added library plugins, which can be automatically loaded
- bugfix: actions were not correctly retried; caused message loss
- changed module loader to automatically add ".so" suffix if not
  specified (over time, this shall also ease portability of config
  files)
- improved debugging support; debug runtime options can now be set via
  an environment variable
- bugfix: removed debugging code that I forgot to remove before releasing
  3.12.0 (does not cause harm and happened only during startup)
- added support for the MonitorWare syslog MIB to omsnmp
- internal code improvements (more code converted into classes)
- internal code reworking of the imtcp/imgssapi module
- added capability to ignore client-provided timestamp on unix sockets and
  made this mode the default; this was needed, as some programs (e.g. sshd)
  log with inconsistent timezone information, what messes up the local
  logs (which by default don't even contain time zone information). This
  seems to be consistent with what sysklogd did for the past four years.
  Alternate behaviour may be desirable if gateway-like processes send
  messages via the local log slot - in this case, it can be enabled
  via the $InputUnixListenSocketIgnoreMsgTimestamp and
  $SystemLogSocketIgnoreMsgTimestamp config directives
- added ability to compile on HP UX; verified that imudp worked on HP UX;
  however, we are still in need of people trying out rsyslogd on HP UX,
  so it can not yet be assumed it runs there
- improved session recovery when outbound tcp connection breaks, reduces
  probability of message loss at the price of a highly unlikely potential
  (single) message duplication
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.12.0 (rgerhards), 2008-02-28
- added full expression support for filters; filters can now contain
  arbitrary complex boolean, string and arithmetic expressions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.6 (rgerhards), 2008-02-27
- bugfix: gssapi libraries were still linked to rsyslog core, what should
  no longer be necessary. Applied fix by Michael Biebl to solve this.
- enabled imgssapi to be loaded side-by-side with imtcp
- added InputGSSServerPermitPlainTCP config directive
- split imgssapi source code somewhat from imtcp
- bugfix: queue cancel cleanup handler could be called with
  invalid pointer if dequeue failed
- bugfix: rsyslogd segfaulted on second SIGHUP
  tracker: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=38
- improved stability of queue engine
- bugfix: queue disk file were not properly persisted when 
  immediately after closing an output file rsyslog was stopped
  or huped (the new output file open must NOT have happend at
  that point) - this lead to a sparse and invalid queue file
  which could cause several problems to the engine (unpredictable
  results). This situation should have happened only in very
  rare cases. tracker: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=40
- bugfix: during queue shutdown, an assert invalidly triggered when
  the primary queue's DA worker was terminated while the DA queue's
  regular worker was still executing. This could result in a segfault
  during shutdown.
  tracker: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41
- bugfix: queue properties sizeOnDisk, bytesRead were persisted to 
  disk with wrong data type (long instead of int64) - could cause
  problems on 32 bit machines
- bugfix: queue aborted when it was shut down, DA-enabled, DA mode
  was just initiated but not fully initialized (a race condition)
- bugfix: imfile could abort under extreme stress conditions
  (when it was terminated before it could open all of its
  to be monitored files)
- applied patch from varmojfekoj to fix an issue with compatibility 
  mode and default module directories (many thanks!):
  I've also noticed a bug in the compatibility code; the problem is that 
  options are parsed before configuration file so options which need a 
  module to be loaded will currently ignore any $moddir directive. This 
  can be fixed by moving legacyOptsHook() after config file parsing. 
  (see the attached patch) This goes against the logical order of 
  processing, but the legacy options are only few and it doesn't seem to 
  be a problem.
- bugfix: object property deserializer did not handle negative numbers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.5 (rgerhards), 2008-02-25
- new imgssapi module, changed imtcp module - this enables to load/package
  GSSAPI support separately - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- compatibility mode (the -c option series) is now at least partly
  completed - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- documentation for imgssapi and imtcp added
- duplicate $ModLoad's for the same module are now detected and
  rejected -- thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.4 (rgerhards), 2008-02-21
- bugfix: debug.html was missing from release tarball - thanks to Michael
  Biebl for bringing this to my attention
- some internal cleanup on the stringbuf object calling interface
- general code cleanup and further modularization
- $MainMessageQueueDiscardSeverity can now also handle textual severities
  (previously only integers)
- bugfix: message object was not properly synchronized when the 
  main queue had a single thread and non-direct action queues were used
- some documentation improvements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.3 (rgerhards), 2008-02-18
- fixed a bug in imklog which lead to duplicate message content in
  kernel logs
- added support for better plugin handling in libdbi (we contributed
  a patch to do that, we just now need to wait for the next libdbi
  version)
- bugfix: fixed abort when invalid template was provided to an action
  bug http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4
- re-instantiated SIGUSR1 function; added SIGUSR2 to generate debug
  status output
- added some documentation on runtime-debug settings
- slightly improved man pages for novice users
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.2 (rgerhards), 2008-02-15
- added the capability to monitor text files and process their content
  as syslog messages (including forwarding)
- added support for libdbi, a database abstraction layer. rsyslog now
  also supports the following databases via dbi drivers:
  * Firebird/Interbase
  * FreeTDS (access to MS SQL Server and Sybase)
  * SQLite/SQLite3
  * Ingres (experimental)
  * mSQL (experimental)
  * Oracle (experimental)
  Additional drivers may be provided by the libdbi-drivers project, which
  can be used by rsyslog as soon as they become available.
- removed some left-over unnecessary dbgprintf's (cluttered screen,
  cosmetic)
- doc bugfix: html documentation for omsnmp was missing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.1 (rgerhards), 2008-02-12
- SNMP trap sender added thanks to Andre Lorbach (omsnmp)
- added input-plugin interface specification in form of a (copy) template
  input module
- applied documentation fix by Michael Biebl -- many thanks!
- bugfix: immark did not have MARK flags set...
- added x-info field to rsyslogd startup/shutdown message. Hopefully
  points users to right location for further info (many don't even know
  they run rsyslog ;))
- bugfix: trailing ":" of tag was lost while parsing legacy syslog messages
  without timestamp - thanks to Anders Blomdell for providing a patch!
- fixed a bug in stringbuf.c related to STRINGBUF_TRIM_ALLOCSIZE, which
  wasn't supposed to be used with rsyslog. Put a warning message up that
  tells this feature is not tested and probably not worth the effort.
  Thanks to Anders Blomdell fro bringing this to our attention
- somewhat improved performance of string buffers
- fixed bug that caused invalid treatment of tabs (HT) in rsyslog.conf
- bugfix: setting for $EscapeCopntrolCharactersOnReceive was not 
  properly initialized
- clarified usage of space-cc property replacer option
- improved abort diagnostic handler
- some initial effort for malloc/free runtime debugging support
- bugfix: using dynafile actions caused rsyslogd abort
- fixed minor man errors thanks to Michael Biebl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.0 (rgerhards), 2008-01-31
- implemented queued actions
- implemented simple rate limiting for actions
- implemented deliberate discarding of lower priority messages over higher
  priority ones when a queue runs out of space
- implemented disk quotas for disk queues
- implemented the $ActionResumeRetryCount config directive
- added $ActionQueueFilename config directive
- added $ActionQueueSize config directive
- added $ActionQueueHighWaterMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueLowWaterMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueDiscardMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueDiscardSeverity config directive
- added $ActionQueueCheckpointInterval config directive
- added $ActionQueueType config directive
- added $ActionQueueWorkerThreads config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutshutdown config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutActionCompletion config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutenQueue config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutworkerThreadShutdown config directive
- added $ActionQueueWorkerThreadMinimumMessages config directive
- added $ActionQueueMaxFileSize config directive
- added $ActionQueueSaveonShutdown config directive
- addded $ActionQueueDequeueSlowdown config directive
- addded $MainMsgQueueDequeueSlowdown config directive
- bugfix: added forgotten docs to package
- improved debugging support
- fixed a bug that caused $MainMsgQueueCheckpointInterval to work incorrectly
- when a long-running action needs to be cancelled on shutdown, the message
  that was processed by it is now preserved. This finishes support for
  guaranteed delivery of messages (if the output supports it, of course)
- fixed bug in output module interface, see
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1881008&group_id=123448&atid=696552
- changed the ommysql output plugin so that the (lengthy) connection
  initialization now takes place in message processing. This works much
  better with the new queued action mode (fast startup)
- fixed a bug that caused a potential hang in file and fwd output module
  varmojfekoj provided the patch - many thanks!
- bugfixed stream class offset handling on 32bit platforms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.3 (rgerhards), 2008-01-28
- fixed a bug with standard template definitions (not a big deal) - thanks
  to varmojfekoj for spotting it
- run-time instrumentation added
- implemented disk-assisted queue mode, which enables on-demand disk
  spooling if the queue's in-memory queue is exhausted
- implemented a dynamic worker thread pool for processing incoming
  messages; workers are started and shut down as need arises
- implemented a run-time instrumentation debug package
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueSaveOnShutdown config directive
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueWorkerThreadMinimumMessages config directive
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueTimeoutWorkerThreadShutdown config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.2 (rgerhards), 2008-01-14
- added the ability to keep stop rsyslogd without the need to drain
  the main message queue. In disk queue mode, rsyslog continues to
  run from the point where it stopped. In case of a system failure, it
  continues to process messages from the last checkpoint.
- fixed a bug that caused a segfault on startup when no $WorkDir directive
  was specified in rsyslog.conf
- provided more fine-grain control over shutdown timeouts and added a
  way to specify the enqueue timeout when the main message queue is full
- implemented $MainMsgQueueCheckpointInterval config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutActionCompletion config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutEnqueue config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutShutdown config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.1 (rgerhards), 2008-01-10
- implemented the "disk" queue mode. However, it currently is of very
  limited use, because it does not support persistence over rsyslogd
  runs. So when rsyslogd is stopped, the queue is drained just as with
  the in-memory queue modes. Persistent queues will be a feature of
  the next release.
- performance-optimized string class, should bring an overall improvement
- fixed a memory leak in imudp -- thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed a race condition that could lead to a rsyslogd hang when during
  HUP or termination
- done some doc updates
- added $WorkDirectory config directive
- added $MainMsgQueueFileName config directive
- added $MainMsgQueueMaxFileSize config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.0 (rgerhards), 2008-01-07
- implemented input module interface and initial input modules
- enhanced threading for input modules (each on its own thread now)
- ability to bind UDP listeners to specific local interfaces/ports and
  ability to run multiple of them concurrently
- added ability to specify listen IP address for UDP syslog server
- license changed to GPLv3
- mark messages are now provided by loadble module immark
- rklogd is no longer provided. Its functionality has now been taken over
  by imklog, a loadable input module. This offers a much better integration
  into rsyslogd and makes sure that the kernel logger process is brought
  up and down at the appropriate times
- enhanced $IncludeConfig directive to support wildcard characters
  (thanks to Michael Biebl)
- all inputs are now implemented as loadable plugins
- enhanced threading model: each input module now runs on its own thread
- enhanced message queue which now supports different queueing methods
  (among others, this can be used for performance fine-tuning)
- added a large number of new configuration directives for the new
  input modules
- enhanced multi-threading utilizing a worker thread pool for the
  main message queue
- compilation without pthreads is no longer supported
- much cleaner code due to new objects and removal of single-threading
  mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.1 STABLE (rgerhards), 2008-01-24
- fixed a bug in integer conversion - but this function was never called,
  so it is not really a useful bug fix ;)
- fixed a bug with standard template definitions (not a big deal) - thanks
  to varmojfekoj for spotting it
- fixed a bug that caused a potential hang in file and fwd output module
  varmojfekoj provided the patch - many thanks!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.0 STABLE (rgerhards), 2008-01-02
- re-release of 1.21.2 as STABLE with no modifications except some
  doc updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.2 (rgerhards), 2007-12-28
- created a gss-api output module. This keeps GSS-API code and
  TCP/UDP code separated. It is also important for forward-
  compatibility with v3. Please note that this change breaks compatibility
  with config files created for 1.21.0 and 1.21.1 - this was considered
  acceptable.
- fixed an error in forwarding retry code (could lead to message corruption
  but surfaced very seldom)
- increased portability for older platforms (AI_NUMERICSERV moved)
- removed socket leak in omfwd.c
- cross-platform patch for GSS-API compile problem on some platforms
  thanks to darix for the patch!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.1 (rgerhards), 2007-12-23
- small doc fix for $IncludeConfig
- fixed a bug in llDestroy()
- bugfix: fixing memory leak when message queue is full and during
  parsing. Thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch.
- bugfix: when compiled without network support, unix sockets were
  not properply closed
- bugfix: memory leak in cfsysline.c/doGetWord() fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.0 (rgerhards), 2007-12-19
- GSS-API support for syslog/TCP connections was added. Thanks to
  varmojfekoj for providing the patch with this functionality
- code cleanup
- enhanced $IncludeConfig directive to support wildcard filenames
- changed some multithreading synchronization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20.1 (rgerhards), 2007-12-12
- corrected a debug setting that survived release. Caused TCP connections
  to be retried unnecessarily often.
- When a hostname ACL was provided and DNS resolution for that name failed,
  ACL processing was stopped at that point. Thanks to mildew for the patch.
  Fedora Bugzilla: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=395911
- fixed a potential race condition, see link for details:
  http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/12/rsyslog-race-condition.html
  Note that the probability of problems from this bug was very remote
- fixed a memory leak that happend when PostgreSQL date formats were
  used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20.0 (rgerhards), 2007-12-07
- an output module for postgres databases has been added. Thanks to
  sur5r for contributing this code
- unloading dynamic modules has been cleaned up, we now have a
  real implementation and not just a dummy "good enough for the time
  being".
- enhanced platform independence - thanks to Bartosz Kuzma and Michael
  Biebl for their very useful contributions
- some general code cleanup (including warnings on 64 platforms, only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.12 (rgerhards), 2007-12-03
- cleaned up the build system (thanks to Michael Biebl for the patch)
- fixed a bug where ommysql was still not compiled with -pthread option
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.11 (rgerhards), 2007-11-29
- applied -pthread option to build when building for multi-threading mode
  hopefully solves an issue with segfaulting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.10 (rgerhards), 2007-10-19
- introdcued the new ":modulename:" syntax for calling module actions
  in selector lines; modified ommysql to support it. This is primarily
  an aid for further modules and a prequisite to actually allow third
  party modules to be created.
- minor fix in slackware startup script, "-r 0" is now "-r0"
- updated rsyslogd doc set man page; now in html format
- undid creation of a separate thread for the main loop -- this did not
  turn out to be needed or useful, so reduce complexity once again.
- added doc fixes provided by Michael Biebl - thanks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.9 (rgerhards), 2007-10-12
- now packaging system which again contains all components in a single
  tarball
- modularized main() a bit more, resulting in less complex code
- experimentally added an additional thread - will see if that affects
  the segfault bug we experience on some platforms. Note that this change
  is scheduled to be removed again later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.8 (rgerhards), 2007-09-27
- improved repeated message processing
- applied patch provided by varmojfekoj to support building ommysql
  in its own way (now also resides in a plugin subdirectory);
  ommysql is now a separate package
- fixed a bug in cvthname() that lead to message loss if part
  of the source hostname would have been dropped
- created some support for distributing ommysql together with the
  main rsyslog package. I need to re-think it in the future, but
  for the time being the current mode is best. I now simply include
  one additional tarball for ommysql inside the main distribution.
  I look forward to user feedback on how this should be done best. In the
  long term, a separate project should be spawend for ommysql, but I'd
  like to do that only after the plugin interface is fully stable (what
  it is not yet).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.7 (rgerhards), 2007-09-25
- added code to handle situations where senders send us messages ending with
  a NUL character. It is now simply removed. This also caused trailing LF
  reduction to fail, when it was followed by such a NUL. This is now also
  handled.
- replaced some non-thread-safe function calls by their thread-safe
  counterparts
- fixed a minor memory leak that occured when the %APPNAME% property was
  used (I think nobody used that in practice)
- fixed a bug that caused signal handlers in cvthname() not to be restored when
  a malicious pointer record was detected and processing of the message been
  stopped for that reason (this should be really rare and can not be related
  to the segfault bug we are hunting).
- fixed a bug in cvthname that lead to passing a wrong parameter - in
  practice, this had no impact.
- general code cleanup (e.g. compiler warnings, comments)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.6 (rgerhards), 2007-09-11
- applied patch by varmojfekoj to change signal handling to the new
  sigaction API set (replacing the depreciated signal() calls and its
  friends.
- fixed a bug that in --enable-debug mode caused an assertion when the
  discard action was used
- cleaned up compiler warnings
- applied patch by varmojfekoj to FIX a bug that could cause 
  segfaults if empty properties were processed using modifying
  options (e.g. space-cc, drop-cc)
- fixed man bug: rsyslogd supports -l option
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.5 (rgerhards), 2007-09-07
- changed part of the CStr interface so that better error tracking
  is provided and the calling sequence is more intuitive (there were
  invalid calls based on a too-weired interface)
- (hopefully) fixed some remaining bugs rooted in wrong use of 
  the CStr class. These could lead to program abort.
- applied patch by varmojfekoj two fix two potential segfault situations
- added $ModDir config directive
- modified $ModLoad so that an absolute path may be specified as
  module name (e.g. /rsyslog/ommysql.so)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.4 (rgerhards/varmojfekoj), 2007-09-04
- fixed a number of small memory leaks - thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- fixed an issue with CString class that could lead to rsyslog abort
  in tplToString() - thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- added a man-version of the config file documenation - thanks to Michel
  Samia for providing the man file
- fixed bug: a template like this causes an infinite loop:
  $template opts,"%programname:::a,b%"
  thanks varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed bug: case changing options crash freeing the string pointer
  because they modify it: $template opts2,"%programname::1:lowercase%"
  thanks varmojfekoj for the patch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.3 (mmeckelein/varmojfekoj), 2007-08-31
- small mem leak fixed (after calling parseSelectorAct) - Thx varmojkekoj
- documentation section "Regular File" und "Blocks" updated
- solved an issue with dynamic file generation - Once again many thanks
  to varmojfekoj
- the negative selector for program name filter (Blocks) does not work as
  expected - Thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- added forwarding information to sysklogd (requires special template)
  to config doc
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.2 (mmeckelein/varmojfekoj), 2007-08-28
- a specifically formed message caused a segfault - Many thanks varmojfekoj
  for providing a patch
- a typo and a weird condition are fixed in msg.c - Thanks again
  varmojfekoj 
- on file creation the file was always owned by root:root. This is fixed
  now - Thanks ypsa for solving this issue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.1 (mmeckelein), 2007-08-22
- a bug that caused a high load when a TCP/UDP connection was closed is 
  fixed now - Thanks mildew for solving this issue
- fixed a bug which caused a segfault on reinit - Thx varmojfekoj for the
  patch
- changed the hardcoded module path "/lib/rsyslog" to $(pkglibdir) in order
  to avoid trouble e.g. on 64 bit platforms (/lib64) - many thanks Peter
  Vrabec and darix, both provided a patch for solving this issue
- enhanced the unloading of modules - thanks again varmojfekoj
- applied a patch from varmojfekoj which fixes various little things in
  MySQL output module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.0 (varmojfekoj/rgerhards), 2007-08-16
- integrated patch from varmojfekoj to make the mysql module a loadable one
  many thanks for the patch, MUCH appreciated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.2 (rgerhards), 2007-08-13
- fixed a bug in outchannel code that caused templates to be incorrectly
  parsed
- fixed a bug in ommysql that caused a wrong ";template" missing message
- added some code for unloading modules; not yet fully complete (and we do
  not yet have loadable modules, so this is no problem)
- removed debian subdirectory by request of a debian packager (this is a special
  subdir for debian and there is also no point in maintaining it when there
  is a debian package available - so I gladly did this) in some cases
- improved overall doc quality (some pages were quite old) and linked to
  more of the online resources.
- improved /contrib/delete_mysql script by adding a host option and some
  other minor modifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.1 (rgerhards), 2007-08-08
- applied a patch from varmojfekoj which solved a potential segfault
  of rsyslogd on HUP
- applied patch from Michel Samia to fix compilation when the pthreads
  feature is disabled
- some code cleanup (moved action object to its own file set)
- add config directive $MainMsgQueueSize, which now allows to configure the
  queue size dynamically
- all compile-time settings are now shown in rsyslogd -v, not just the
  active ones
- enhanced performance a little bit more
- added config file directive $ActionResumeInterval
- fixed a bug that prevented compilation under debian sid
- added a contrib directory for user-contributed useful things
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.0 (rgerhards), 2007-08-03
- rsyslog now supports fallback actions when an action did not work. This
  is a great feature e.g. for backup database servers or backup syslog
  servers
- modified rklogd to only change the console log level if -c is specified
- added feature to use multiple actions inside a single selector
- implemented $ActionExecOnlyWhenPreviousIsSuspended config directive
- error messages during startup are now spit out to the configured log
  destinations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.6 (rgerhards), 2007-08-01
- continued to work on output module modularization - basic stage of
  this work is now FINISHED
- fixed bug in OMSRcreate() - always returned SR_RET_OK
- fixed a bug that caused ommysql to always complain about missing
  templates
- fixed a mem leak in OMSRdestruct - freeing the object itself was
  forgotten - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed a memory leak in syslogd/init() that happend when the config
  file could not be read - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed insufficient memory allocation in addAction() and its helpers.
  The initial fix and idea was developed by mildew, I fine-tuned
  it a bit. Thanks a lot for the fix, I'd probably had pulled out my
  hair to find the bug...
- added output of config file line number when a parsing error occured
- fixed bug in objomsr.c that caused program to abort in debug mode with
  an invalid assertion (in some cases)
- fixed a typo that caused the default template for MySQL to be wrong.
  thanks to mildew for catching this.
- added configuration file command $DebugPrintModuleList and
  $DebugPrintCfSysLineHandlerList
- fixed an invalid value for the MARK timer - unfortunately, there was
  a testing aid left in place. This resulted in quite frequent MARK messages
- added $IncludeConfig config directive
- applied a patch from mildew to prevent rsyslogd from freezing under heavy
  load. This could happen when the queue was full. Now, we drop messages
  but rsyslogd remains active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.5 (rgerhards), 2007-07-30
- continued to work on output module modularization
- fixed a missing file bug - thanks to Andrea Montanari for reporting
  this problem
- fixed a problem with shutting down the worker thread and freeing the
  selector_t list - this caused messages to be lost, because the
  message queue was not properly drained before the selectors got
  destroyed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.4 (rgerhards), 2007-07-27
- continued to work on output module modularization
- fixed a situation where rsyslogd could create zombie processes
  thanks to mildew for the patch
- applied patch from Michel Samia to fix compilation when NOT
  compiled for pthreads
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.3 (rgerhards), 2007-07-25
- continued working on output module modularization
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault on exit (and
  probably also on HUP), when there was an unsent message in a selector
  that required forwarding and the dns lookup failed for that selector
  (yes, it was pretty unlikely to happen;))
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed a memory leak in config file parsing and die()
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- rsyslogd now checks on startup if it is capable to performa any work
  at all. If it cant, it complains and terminates
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- fixed a small memory leak when HUPing syslogd. The allowed sender
  list now gets freed. thanks to mildew for the patch.
- changed the way error messages in early startup are logged. They
  now do no longer use the syslogd code directly but are rather
  send to stderr.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.2 (rgerhards), 2007-07-23
- made the port part of the -r option optional. Needed for backward
  compatibility with sysklogd
- replaced system() calls with something more reasonable. Please note that
  this might break compatibility with some existing configuration files.
  We accept this in favour of the gained security.
- removed a memory leak that could occur if timegenerated was used in
  RFC 3164 format in templates
- did some preparation in msg.c for advanced multithreading - placed the
  hooks, but not yet any active code
- worked further on modularization
- added $ModLoad MySQL (dummy) config directive
- added DropTrailingLFOnReception config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.1 (rgerhards), 2007-07-20
- fixed a bug that caused make install to install rsyslogd and rklogd under
  the wrong names
- fixed bug that caused $AllowedSenders to handle IPv6 scopes incorrectly;
  also fixed but that could grabble $AllowedSender wildcards. Thanks to
  mildew@gmail.com for the patch
- minor code cleanup - thanks to Peter Vrabec for the patch
- fixed minimal memory leak on HUP (caused by templates)
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed another memory leak on HUPing and on exiting rsyslogd
  again thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- code cleanup (removed compiler warnings)
- fixed portability bug in configure.ac - thanks to Bartosz KuÅºma for patch
- moved msg object into its own file set
- added the capability to continue trying to write log files when the
  file system is full. Functionality based on patch by Martin Schulze
  to sysklogd package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.0 (RGer), 2007-07-17
- added $RepeatedLineReduction config parameter
- added $EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive config parameter
- added $ControlCharacterEscapePrefix config parameter
- added $DirCreateMode config parameter
- added $CreateDirs config parameter
- added $DebugPrintTemplateList config parameter
- added $ResetConfigVariables config parameter
- added $FileOwner config parameter
- added $FileGroup config parameter
- added $DirOwner config parameter
- added $DirGroup config parameter
- added $FailOnChownFailure config parameter
- added regular expression support to the filter engine
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- enhanced $AllowedSender functionality. Credits to mildew@gmail.com for
  the patch doing that
  - added IPv6 support
  - allowed DNS hostnames
  - allowed DNS wildcard names
- added new option $DropMsgsWithMaliciousDnsPTRRecords
- added autoconf so that rfc3195d, rsyslogd and klogd are stored to /sbin
- added capability to auto-create directories with dynaFiles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.16.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-07-13 - The Friday, 13th Release ;)
- build system switched to autotools
- removed SYSV preprocessor macro use, replaced with autotools equivalents
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault when TCP listening was
  disabled and it terminated
- added new properties "syslogfacility-text" and "syslogseverity-text"
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- added the -x option to disable hostname dns reslution
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- begun to better modularize syslogd.c - this is an ongoing project; moved
  type definitions to a separate file
- removed some now-unused fields from struct filed
- move file size limit fields in struct field to the "right spot" (the file
  writing part of the union - f_un.f_file)
- subdirectories linux and solaris are no longer part of the distribution
  package. This is not because we cease support for them, but there are no
  longer any files in them after the move to autotools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.1 (RGer), 2007-07-10
- fixed a bug that caused a dynaFile selector to stall when there was
  an open error with one file 
- improved template processing for dynaFiles; templates are now only
  looked up during initialization - speeds up processing
- optimized memory layout in struct filed when compiled with MySQL
  support
- fixed a bug that caused compilation without SYSLOG_INET to fail
- re-enabled the "last message repeated n times" feature. This
  feature was not taken care of while rsyslogd evolved from sysklogd
  and it was more or less defunct. Now it is fully functional again.
- added system properties: $NOW, $YEAR, $MONTH, $DAY, $HOUR, $MINUTE
- fixed a bug in iovAsString() that caused a memory leak under stress
  conditions (most probably memory shortage). This was unlikely to
  ever happen, but it doesn't hurt doing it right
- cosmetic: defined type "uchar", change all unsigned chars to uchar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.0 (RGer), 2007-07-05
- added ability to dynamically generate file names based on templates
  and thus properties. This was a much-requested feature. It makes
  life easy when it e.g. comes to splitting files based on the sender
  address.
- added $umask and $FileCreateMode config file directives
- applied a patch from Bartosz Kuzma to compile cleanly under NetBSD
- checks for extra (unexpected) characters in system config file lines
  have been added
- added IPv6 documentation - was accidently missing from CVS
- begun to change char to unsigned char
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.2 (RGer), 2007-07-03
** this release fixes all known nits with IPv6 **
- restored capability to do /etc/service lookup for "syslog"
  service when -r 0 was given
- documented IPv6 handling of syslog messages
- integrate patch from Bartosz KuÅºma to make rsyslog compile under
  Solaris again (the patch replaced a strndup() call, which is not
  available under Solaris
- improved debug logging when waiting on select
- updated rsyslogd man page with new options (-46A)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.1 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-29
- added Peter Vrabec's patch for IPv6 TCP
- prefixed all messages send to stderr in rsyslogd with "rsyslogd: "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-28
- Peter Vrabec provided IPv6 for rsyslog, so we are now IPv6 enabled
  IPv6 Support is currently for UDP only, TCP is to come soon.
  AllowedSender configuration does not yet work for IPv6.
- fixed code in iovCreate() that broke C's strict aliasing rules 
- fixed some char/unsigned char differences that forced the compiler
  to spit out warning messages
- updated the Red Hat init script to fix a known issue (thanks to
  Peter Vrabec)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.5 (RGer), 2007-06-22
- made the TCP session limit configurable via command line switch
  now -t <port>,<max sessions>
- added man page for rklogd(8) (basically a copy from klogd, but now
  there is one...)
- fixed a bug that caused internal messages (e.g. rsyslogd startup) to
  appear without a tag.
- removed a minor memory leak that occurred when TAG processing requalified
  a HOSTNAME to be a TAG (and a TAG already was set).
- removed potential small memory leaks in MsgSet***() functions. There
  would be a leak if a property was re-set, something that happened
  extremely seldom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.4 (RGer), 2007-06-18
- added a new property "PRI-text", which holds the PRI field in
  textual form (e.g. "syslog.info")
- added alias "syslogseverity" for "syslogpriority", which is a
  misleading property name that needs to stay for historical
  reasons (and backward-compatility)
- added doc on how to record PRI value in log file
- enhanced signal handling in klogd, including removal of an unsafe
  call to the logging system during signal handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.3 (RGer), 2007-06-15
- create a version of syslog.c from scratch. This is now
  - highly optimized for rsyslog
  - removes an incompatible license problem as the original
    version had a BSD license with advertising clause
  - fixed in the regard that rklogd will continue to work when
    rsysogd has been restarted (the original version, as well
    as sysklogd, will remain silent then)
  - solved an issue with an extra NUL char at message end that the
    original version had
- applied some changes to klogd to care for the new interface
- fixed a bug in syslogd.c which prevented compiling under debian
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.2 (RGer), 2007-06-13
- lib order in makefile patched to facilitate static linking - thanks
  to Bennett Todd for providing the patch
- Integrated a patch from Peter Vrabec (pvrabec@redheat.com):
  - added klogd under the name of rklogd (remove dependency on
    original sysklogd package
  - createDB.sql now in UTF
  - added additional config files for use on Red Hat
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.1 (RGer), 2007-02-05
- changed the listen backlog limit to a more reasonable value based on
  the maximum number of TCP connections configurd (10% + 5) - thanks to Guy
  Standen for the hint (actually, the limit was 5 and that was a 
  left-over from early testing).
- fixed a bug in makefile which caused DB-support to be disabled when
  NETZIP support was enabled
- added the -e option to allow transmission of every message to remote
  hosts (effectively turns off duplicate message suppression)
- (somewhat) improved memory consumption when compiled with MySQL support
- looks like we fixed an incompatibility with MySQL 5.x and above software
  At least in one case, the remote server name was destroyed, leading to 
  a connection failure. The new, improved code does not have this issue and
  so we see this as solved (the new code is generally somewhat better, so
  there is a good chance we fixed this incompatibility).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.0 (RGer), 2006-12-19
- added '$' as ToPos proptery replacer specifier - means "up to the
  end of the string"
- property replacer option "escape-cc", "drop-cc" and "space-cc"  added
- changed the handling of \0 characters inside syslog messages. We now
  consistently escape them to "#000". This is somewhat recommended in
  the draft-ietf-syslog-protocol-19 draft. While the real recomendation
  is to not escape any characters at all, we can not do this without
  considerable modification of the code. So we escape it to "#000", which
  is consistent with a sample found in the Internet-draft.
- removed message glue logic (see printchopped() comment for details)
  Also caused removal of parts table and thus some improvements in
  memory usage.
- changed the default MAXLINE to 2048 to take care of recent syslog
  standardization efforts (can easily be changed in syslogd.c)
- added support for byte-counted TCP syslog messages (much like
  syslog-transport-tls-05 Internet Draft). This was necessary to
  support compression over TCP.
- added support for receiving compressed syslog messages
- added support for sending compressed syslog messages
- fixed a bug where the last message in a syslog/tcp stream was
  lost if it was not properly terminated by a LF character
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.3 (RGer), 2006-10-04
- implemented some changes to support Solaris (but support is not
  yet complete)
- commented out (via #if 0) some methods that are currently not being use
  but should be kept for further us
- added (interim) -u 1 option to turn off hostname and tag parsing
- done some modifications to better support Fedora
- made the field delimiter inside property replace configurable via
  template
- fixed a bug in property replacer: if fields were used, the delimitor
  became part of the field. Up until now, this was barely noticable as 
  the delimiter as TAB only and thus invisible to a human. With other
  delimiters available now, it quickly showed up. This bug fix might cause
  some grief to existing installations if they used the extra TAB for
  whatever reasons - sorry folks... Anyhow, a solution is easy: just add
  a TAB character contstant into your template. Thus, there has no attempt
  been made to do this in a backwards-compatible way.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.2 (RGer), 2006-02-15
- fixed a bug in the RFC 3339 date formatter. An extra space was added
  after the actual timestamp
- added support for providing high-precision RFC3339 timestamps for
  (rsyslogd-)internally-generated messages
- very (!) experimental support for syslog-protocol internet draft
  added (the draft is experimental, the code is solid ;))
- added support for field-extracting in the property replacer
- enhanced the legacy-syslog parser so that it can interpret messages
  that do not contain a TIMESTAMP
- fixed a bug that caused the default socket (usually /dev/log) to be
  opened even when -o command line option was given
- fixed a bug in the Debian sample startup script - it caused rsyslogd
  to listen to remote requests, which it shouldn't by default
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.1 (RGer), 2005-11-23
- made multithreading work with BSD. Some signal-handling needed to be
  restructured. Also, there might be a slight delay of up to 10 seconds
  when huping and terminating rsyslogd under BSD
- fixed a bug where a NULL-pointer was passed to printf() in logmsg().
- fixed a bug during "make install" where rc3195d was not installed
  Thanks to Bennett Todd for spotting this.
- fixed a bug where rsyslogd dumped core when no TAG was found in the
  received message
- enhanced message parser so that it can deal with missing hostnames
  in many cases (may not be totally fail-safe)
- fixed a bug where internally-generated messages did not have the correct
  TAG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.0 (RGer), 2005-10-26
- moved to a multi-threaded design. single-threading is still optionally
  available. Multi-threading is experimental!
- fixed a potential race condition. In the original code, marking was done
  by an alarm handler, which could lead to all sorts of bad things. This
  has been changed now. See comments in syslogd.c/domark() for details.
- improved debug output for property-based filters
- not a code change, but: I have checked all exit()s to make sure that
  none occurs once rsyslogd has started up. Even in unusual conditions
  (like low-memory conditions) rsyslogd somehow remains active. Of course,
  it might loose a message or two, but at least it does not abort and it
  can also recover when the condition no longer persists.
- fixed a bug that could cause loss of the last message received
  immediately before rsyslogd was terminated.
- added comments on thread-safety of global variables in syslogd.c
- fixed a small bug: spurios printf() when TCP syslog was used
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug with regular expression support (thanks to Andres Riancho)
- a little bit of code restructuring (especially main(), which was
  horribly large)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.1 (RGer), 2005-10-19
- support for BSD-style program name and host blocks
- added a new property "programname" that can be used in templates
- added ability to specify listen port for rfc3195d
- fixed a bug that rendered the "startswith" comparison operation
  unusable.
- changed more functions to "static" storage class to help compiler
  optimize (should have been static in the first place...)
- fixed a potential memory leak in the string buffer class destructor.
  As the destructur was previously never called, the leak did not actually
  appear.
- some internal restructuring in anticipation/preparation of minimal
  multi-threading support
- rsyslogd still shares some code with the sysklogd project. Some patches
  for this shared code have been brought over from the sysklogd CVS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.0 (RGer), 2005-10-12
- support for receiving messages via RFC 3195; added rfc3195d for that
  purpose
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.2 (RGer), 2005-09-27
- added comparison operations in property-based filters:
  * isequal
  * startswith
- added ability to negate all property-based filter comparison operations
  by adding a !-sign right in front of the operation name
- added the ability to specify remote senders for UDP and TCP
  received messages. Allows to block all but well-known hosts
- changed the $-config line directives to be case-INsensitive
- new command line option -w added: "do not display warnings if messages
  from disallowed senders are received"
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to dump core when the compare value
  was not quoted in property-based filters
- fixed a bug in the new CStr compare function which lead to invalid
  results (fortunately, this function was not yet used widely)
- added better support for "debugging" rsyslog.conf property filters
  (only if -d switch is given)
- changed some function definitions to static, which eventually enables
  some compiler optimizations
- fixed a bug in MySQL code; when a SQL error occured, rsyslogd could
  run in a tight loop. This was due to invalid sequence of error reporting
  and is now fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- added the ability to execute a shell script as an action.
  Thanks to Bjoern Kalkbrenner for providing the code!
- fixed a bug in the MySQL code; due to the bug the automatic one-time
  retry after an error did not happen - this lead to error message in
  cases where none should be seen (e.g. after a MySQL restart)
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.0 (RGer), 2005-09-20
  REMINDER: 1.10 is the first unstable version if the 1.x series!
- added the capability to filter on any property in selector lines
  (not just facility and priority)
- changed stringbuf into a new counted string class
- added support for a "discard" action. If a selector line with
  discard (~ character) is found, no selector lines *after* that
  line will be processed.
- thanks to Andres Riancho, regular expression support has been
  added to the template engine
- added the FROMHOST property in the template processor, which could
  previously not be obtained. Thanks to Cristian Testa for pointing
  this out and even providing a fix.
- added display of compile-time options to -v output
- performance improvement for production build - made some checks
  to happen only during debug mode
- fixed a problem with compiling on SUSE and - while doing so - removed
  the socket call to set SO_BSDCOMPAT in cases where it is obsolete.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.4 (RGer), 2006-02-01
- a small but important fix: the tcp receiver had two forgotten printf's
  in it that caused a lot of unnecessary output to stdout. This was
  important enough to justify a new release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.3 (RGer), 2005-11-14
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
- applied some patches available from the sysklogd project to code
  shared from there
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug in the TCP sender that caused the retry logic to fail
  after an error or receiver overrun
- fixed a bug in init() that could lead to dumping core
- fixed a bug that could lead to dumping core when no HOSTNAME or no TAG
  was present in the syslog message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.2 (RGer), 2005-10-05
- fixed an issue with MySQL error reporting. When an error occured,
  the MySQL driver went into an endless loop (at least in most cases).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (RGer), 2005-09-12
- changed install doc to cover daily cron scripts - a trouble source
- added rc script for slackware (provided by Chris Elvidge - thanks!) 
- fixed a really minor bug in usage() - the -r option was still
  reported as without the port parameter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.8 (RGer), 2005-09-05
- made startup and shutdown message more consistent and included the
  pid, so that they can be easier correlated. Used syslog-protocol
  structured data format for this purpose.
- improved config info in startup message, now tells not only
  if it is listening remote on udp, but also for tcp. Also includes
  the port numbers. The previous startup message was misleading, because
  it did not say "remote reception" if rsyslogd was only listening via
  tcp (but not via udp).
- added a "how can you help" document to the doc set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.7 (RGer), 2005-08-15
- some of the previous doc files (like INSTALL) did not properly
  reflect the changes to the build process and the new doc. Fixed
  that.
- changed syslogd.c so that when compiled without database support,
  an error message is displayed when a database action is detected
  in the config file (previously this was used as an user rule ;))
- fixed a bug in the os-specific Makefiles which caused MySQL
  support to not be compiled, even if selected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.6 (RGer), 2005-08-09
- greatly enhanced documentation. Now available in html format in
  the "doc" folder and FreeBSD. Finally includes an install howto.
- improved MySQL error messages a little - they now show up as log
  messages, too (formerly only in debug mode)
- added the ability to specify the listen port for udp syslog.
  WARNING: This introduces an incompatibility. Formerly, udp
  syslog was enabled by the -r command line option. Now, it is
  "-r [port]", which is consistent with the tcp listener. However,
  just -r will now return an error message.
- added sample startup scripts for Debian and FreeBSD
- added support for easy feature selection in the makefile. Un-
  fortunately, this also means I needed to spilt the make file
  for different OS and distros. There are some really bad syntax
  differences between FreeBSD and Linux make.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.5 (RGer), 2005-08-01
- the "semicolon bug" was actually not (fully) solved in 0.9.4. One
  part of the bug was solved, but another still existed. This one
  is fixed now, too.
- the "semicolon bug" actually turned out to be a more generic bug.
  It appeared whenever an invalid template name was given. With some
  selector actions, rsyslogd dumped core, with other it "just" had
  a small ressource leak with others all worked well. These anomalies
  are now fixed. Note that they only appeared during system initaliziation
  once the system was running, nothing bad happened.
- improved error reporting for template errors on startup. They are now
  shown on the console and the start-up tty. Formerly, they were only
  visible in debug mode.
- support for multiple instances of rsyslogd on a single machine added
- added new option "-o" --> omit local unix domain socket. This option
  enables rsyslogd NOT to listen to the local socket. This is most
  helpful when multiple instances of rsyslogd (or rsyslogd and another
  syslogd) shall run on a single system.
- added new option "-i <pidfile>" which allows to specify the pidfile.
  This is needed when multiple instances of rsyslogd are to be run.
- the new project home page is now online at www.rsyslog.com
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.4 (RGer), 2005-07-25
- finally added the TCP sender. It now supports non-blocking mode, no
  longer disabling message reception during connect. As it is now, it
  is usable in production. The code could be more sophisticated, but
  I've kept it short in anticipation of the move to liblogging, which
  will lead to the removal of the code just written ;)
- the "exiting on signal..." message still had the "syslogd" name in 
  it. Changed this to "rsyslogd", as we do not have a large user base
  yet, this should pose no problem.
- fixed "the semiconlon" bug. rsyslogd dumped core if a write-db action
  was specified but no semicolon was given after the password (an empty
  template was ok, but the semicolon needed to be present).
- changed a default for traditional output format. During testing, it
  was seen that the timestamp written to file in default format was
  the time of message reception, not the time specified in the TIMESTAMP
  field of the message itself. Traditionally, the message TIMESTAMP is
  used and this has been changed now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.3 (RGer), 2005-07-19
- fixed a bug in the message parser. In June, the RFC 3164 timestamp
  was not correctly parsed (yes, only in June and some other months,
  see the code comment to learn why...)
- added the ability to specify the destination port when forwarding
  syslog messages (both for TCP and UDP)
- added an very experimental TCP sender (activated by
  @@machine:port in config). This is not yet for production use. If
  the receiver is not alive, rsyslogd will wait quite some time until
  the connection request times out, which most probably leads to
  loss of incoming messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.2 (RGer), around 2005-07-06
- I intended to change the maxsupported message size to 32k to
  support IHE - but given the memory inefficiency in the usual use
  cases, I have not done this. I have, however, included very
  specific instructions on how to do this in the source code. I have
  also done some testing with 32k messages, so you can change the
  max size without taking too much risk.
- added a syslog/tcp receiver; we now can receive messages via
  plain tcp, but we can still send only via UDP. The syslog/tcp
  receiver is the primary enhancement of this release.
- slightly changed some error messages that contained a spurios \n at
  the end of the line (which gives empty lines in your log...)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.1 (RGer)
- fixed code so that it compiles without errors under FreeBSD
- removed now unused function "allocate_log()" from syslogd.c
- changed the make file so that it contains more defines for
  different environments (in the long term, we need a better
  system for disabling/enabling features...)
- changed some printf's printing off_t types to %lld and
  explicit (long long) casts. I tried to figure out the exact type,
  but did not succeed in this. In the worst case, ultra-large peta-
  byte files will now display funny informational messages on rollover,
  something I think we can live with for the neersion 3.11.2 (rgerhards), 2008-02-??
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.1 (rgerhards), 2008-02-12
- SNMP trap sender added thanks to Andre Lorbach (omsnmp)
- added input-plugin interface specification in form of a (copy) template
  input module
- applied documentation fix by Michael Biebl -- many thanks!
- bugfix: immark did not have MARK flags set...
- added x-info field to rsyslogd startup/shutdown message. Hopefully
  points users to right location for further info (many don't even know
  they run rsyslog ;))
- bugfix: trailing ":" of tag was lost while parsing legacy syslog messages
  without timestamp - thanks to Anders Blomdell for providing a patch!
- fixed a bug in stringbuf.c related to STRINGBUF_TRIM_ALLOCSIZE, which
  wasn't supposed to be used with rsyslog. Put a warning message up that
  tells this feature is not tested and probably not worth the effort.
  Thanks to Anders Blomdell fro bringing this to our attention
- somewhat improved performance of string buffers
- fixed bug that caused invalid treatment of tabs (HT) in rsyslog.conf
- bugfix: setting for $EscapeCopntrolCharactersOnReceive was not 
  properly initialized
- clarified usage of space-cc property replacer option
- improved abort diagnostic handler
- some initial effort for malloc/free runtime debugging support
- bugfix: using dynafile actions caused rsyslogd abort
- fixed minor man errors thanks to Michael Biebl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.0 (rgerhards), 2008-01-31
- implemented queued actions
- implemented simple rate limiting for actions
- implemented deliberate discarding of lower priority messages over higher
  priority ones when a queue runs out of space
- implemented disk quotas for disk queues
- implemented the $ActionResumeRetryCount config directive
- added $ActionQueueFilename config directive
- added $ActionQueueSize config directive
- added $ActionQueueHighWaterMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueLowWaterMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueDiscardMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueDiscardSeverity config directive
- added $ActionQueueCheckpointInterval config directive
- added $ActionQueueType config directive
- added $ActionQueueWorkerThreads config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutshutdown config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutActionCompletion config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutenQueue config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutworkerThreadShutdown config directive
- added $ActionQueueWorkerThreadMinimumMessages config directive
- added $ActionQueueMaxFileSize config directive
- added $ActionQueueSaveonShutdown config directive
- addded $ActionQueueDequeueSlowdown config directive
- addded $MainMsgQueueDequeueSlowdown config directive
- bugfix: added forgotten docs to package
- improved debugging support
- fixed a bug that caused $MainMsgQueueCheckpointInterval to work incorrectly
- when a long-running action needs to be cancelled on shutdown, the message
  that was processed by it is now preserved. This finishes support for
  guaranteed delivery of messages (if the output supports it, of course)
- fixed bug in output module interface, see
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1881008&group_id=123448&atid=696552
- changed the ommysql output plugin so that the (lengthy) connection
  initialization now takes place in message processing. This works much
  better with the new queued action mode (fast startup)
- fixed a bug that caused a potential hang in file and fwd output module
  varmojfekoj provided the patch - many thanks!
- bugfixed stream class offset handling on 32bit platforms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.3 (rgerhards), 2008-01-28
- fixed a bug with standard template definitions (not a big deal) - thanks
  to varmojfekoj for spotting it
- run-time instrumentation added
- implemented disk-assisted queue mode, which enables on-demand disk
  spooling if the queue's in-memory queue is exhausted
- implemented a dynamic worker thread pool for processing incoming
  messages; workers are started and shut down as need arises
- implemented a run-time instrumentation debug package
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueSaveOnShutdown config directive
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueWorkerThreadMinimumMessages config directive
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueTimeoutWorkerThreadShutdown config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.2 (rgerhards), 2008-01-14
- added the ability to keep stop rsyslogd without the need to drain
  the main message queue. In disk queue mode, rsyslog continues to
  run from the point where it stopped. In case of a system failure, it
  continues to process messages from the last checkpoint.
- fixed a bug that caused a segfault on startup when no $WorkDir directive
  was specified in rsyslog.conf
- provided more fine-grain control over shutdown timeouts and added a
  way to specify the enqueue timeout when the main message queue is full
- implemented $MainMsgQueueCheckpointInterval config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutActionCompletion config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutEnqueue config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutShutdown config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.1 (rgerhards), 2008-01-10
- implemented the "disk" queue mode. However, it currently is of very
  limited use, because it does not support persistence over rsyslogd
  runs. So when rsyslogd is stopped, the queue is drained just as with
  the in-memory queue modes. Persistent queues will be a feature of
  the next release.
- performance-optimized string class, should bring an overall improvement
- fixed a memory leak in imudp -- thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed a race condition that could lead to a rsyslogd hang when during
  HUP or termination
- done some doc updates
- added $WorkDirectory config directive
- added $MainMsgQueueFileName config directive
- added $MainMsgQueueMaxFileSize config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.0 (rgerhards), 2008-01-07
- implemented input module interface and initial input modules
- enhanced threading for input modules (each on its own thread now)
- ability to bind UDP listeners to specific local interfaces/ports and
  ability to run multiple of them concurrently
- added ability to specify listen IP address for UDP syslog server
- license changed to GPLv3
- mark messages are now provided by loadble module immark
- rklogd is no longer provided. Its functionality has now been taken over
  by imklog, a loadable input module. This offers a much better integration
  into rsyslogd and makes sure that the kernel logger process is brought
  up and down at the appropriate times
- enhanced $IncludeConfig directive to support wildcard characters
  (thanks to Michael Biebl)
- all inputs are now implemented as loadable plugins
- enhanced threading model: each input module now runs on its own thread
- enhanced message queue which now supports different queueing methods
  (among others, this can be used for performance fine-tuning)
- added a large number of new configuration directives for the new
  input modules
- enhanced multi-threading utilizing a worker thread pool for the
  main message queue
- compilation without pthreads is no longer supported
- much cleaner code due to new objects and removal of single-threading
  mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.1 STABLE (rgerhards), 2008-01-24
- fixed a bug in integer conversion - but this function was never called,
  so it is not really a useful bug fix ;)
- fixed a bug with standard template definitions (not a big deal) - thanks
  to varmojfekoj for spotting it
- fixed a bug that caused a potential hang in file and fwd output module
  varmojfekoj provided the patch - many thanks!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.0 STABLE (rgerhards), 2008-01-02
- re-release of 1.21.2 as STABLE with no modifications except some
  doc updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.2 (rgerhards), 2007-12-28
- created a gss-api output module. This keeps GSS-API code and
  TCP/UDP code separated. It is also important for forward-
  compatibility with v3. Please note that this change breaks compatibility
  with config files created for 1.21.0 and 1.21.1 - this was considered
  acceptable.
- fixed an error in forwarding retry code (could lead to message corruption
  but surfaced very seldom)
- increased portability for older platforms (AI_NUMERICSERV moved)
- removed socket leak in omfwd.c
- cross-platform patch for GSS-API compile problem on some platforms
  thanks to darix for the patch!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.1 (rgerhards), 2007-12-23
- small doc fix for $IncludeConfig
- fixed a bug in llDestroy()
- bugfix: fixing memory leak when message queue is full and during
  parsing. Thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch.
- bugfix: when compiled without network support, unix sockets were
  not properply closed
- bugfix: memory leak in cfsysline.c/doGetWord() fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.0 (rgerhards), 2007-12-19
- GSS-API support for syslog/TCP connections was added. Thanks to
  varmojfekoj for providing the patch with this functionality
- code cleanup
- enhanced $IncludeConfig directive to support wildcard filenames
- changed some multithreading synchronization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20.1 (rgerhards), 2007-12-12
- corrected a debug setting that survived release. Caused TCP connections
  to be retried unnecessarily often.
- When a hostname ACL was provided and DNS resolution for that name failed,
  ACL processing was stopped at that point. Thanks to mildew for the patch.
  Fedora Bugzilla: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=395911
- fixed a potential race condition, see link for details:
  http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/12/rsyslog-race-condition.html
  Note that the probability of problems from this bug was very remote
- fixed a memory leak that happend when PostgreSQL date formats were
  used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20.0 (rgerhards), 2007-12-07
- an output module for postgres databases has been added. Thanks to
  sur5r for contributing this code
- unloading dynamic modules has been cleaned up, we now have a
  real implementation and not just a dummy "good enough for the time
  being".
- enhanced platform independence - thanks to Bartosz Kuzma and Michael
  Biebl for their very useful contributions
- some general code cleanup (including warnings on 64 platforms, only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.12 (rgerhards), 2007-12-03
- cleaned up the build system (thanks to Michael Biebl for the patch)
- fixed a bug where ommysql was still not compiled with -pthread option
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.11 (rgerhards), 2007-11-29
- applied -pthread option to build when building for multi-threading mode
  hopefully solves an issue with segfaulting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.10 (rgerhards), 2007-10-19
- introdcued the new ":modulename:" syntax for calling module actions
  in selector lines; modified ommysql to support it. This is primarily
  an aid for further modules and a prequisite to actually allow third
  party modules to be created.
- minor fix in slackware startup script, "-r 0" is now "-r0"
- updated rsyslogd doc set man page; now in html format
- undid creation of a separate thread for the main loop -- this did not
  turn out to be needed or useful, so reduce complexity once again.
- added doc fixes provided by Michael Biebl - thanks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.9 (rgerhards), 2007-10-12
- now packaging system which again contains all components in a single
  tarball
- modularized main() a bit more, resulting in less complex code
- experimentally added an additional thread - will see if that affects
  the segfault bug we experience on some platforms. Note that this change
  is scheduled to be removed again later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.8 (rgerhards), 2007-09-27
- improved repeated message processing
- applied patch provided by varmojfekoj to support building ommysql
  in its own way (now also resides in a plugin subdirectory);
  ommysql is now a separate package
- fixed a bug in cvthname() that lead to message loss if part
  of the source hostname would have been dropped
- created some support for distributing ommysql together with the
  main rsyslog package. I need to re-think it in the future, but
  for the time being the current mode is best. I now simply include
  one additional tarball for ommysql inside the main distribution.
  I look forward to user feedback on how this should be done best. In the
  long term, a separate project should be spawend for ommysql, but I'd
  like to do that only after the plugin interface is fully stable (what
  it is not yet).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.7 (rgerhards), 2007-09-25
- added code to handle situations where senders send us messages ending with
  a NUL character. It is now simply removed. This also caused trailing LF
  reduction to fail, when it was followed by such a NUL. This is now also
  handled.
- replaced some non-thread-safe function calls by their thread-safe
  counterparts
- fixed a minor memory leak that occured when the %APPNAME% property was
  used (I think nobody used that in practice)
- fixed a bug that caused signal handlers in cvthname() not to be restored when
  a malicious pointer record was detected and processing of the message been
  stopped for that reason (this should be really rare and can not be related
  to the segfault bug we are hunting).
- fixed a bug in cvthname that lead to passing a wrong parameter - in
  practice, this had no impact.
- general code cleanup (e.g. compiler warnings, comments)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.6 (rgerhards), 2007-09-11
- applied patch by varmojfekoj to change signal handling to the new
  sigaction API set (replacing the depreciated signal() calls and its
  friends.
- fixed a bug that in --enable-debug mode caused an assertion when the
  discard action was used
- cleaned up compiler warnings
- applied patch by varmojfekoj to FIX a bug that could cause 
  segfaults if empty properties were processed using modifying
  options (e.g. space-cc, drop-cc)
- fixed man bug: rsyslogd supports -l option
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.5 (rgerhards), 2007-09-07
- changed part of the CStr interface so that better error tracking
  is provided and the calling sequence is more intuitive (there were
  invalid calls based on a too-weired interface)
- (hopefully) fixed some remaining bugs rooted in wrong use of 
  the CStr class. These could lead to program abort.
- applied patch by varmojfekoj two fix two potential segfault situations
- added $ModDir config directive
- modified $ModLoad so that an absolute path may be specified as
  module name (e.g. /rsyslog/ommysql.so)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.4 (rgerhards/varmojfekoj), 2007-09-04
- fixed a number of small memory leaks - thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- fixed an issue with CString class that could lead to rsyslog abort
  in tplToString() - thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- added a man-version of the config file documenation - thanks to Michel
  Samia for providing the man file
- fixed bug: a template like this causes an infinite loop:
  $template opts,"%programname:::a,b%"
  thanks varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed bug: case changing options crash freeing the string pointer
  because they modify it: $template opts2,"%programname::1:lowercase%"
  thanks varmojfekoj for the patch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.3 (mmeckelein/varmojfekoj), 2007-08-31
- small mem leak fixed (after calling parseSelectorAct) - Thx varmojkekoj
- documentation section "Regular File" und "Blocks" updated
- solved an issue with dynamic file generation - Once again many thanks
  to varmojfekoj
- the negative selector for program name filter (Blocks) does not work as
  expected - Thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- added forwarding information to sysklogd (requires special template)
  to config doc
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.2 (mmeckelein/varmojfekoj), 2007-08-28
- a specifically formed message caused a segfault - Many thanks varmojfekoj
  for providing a patch
- a typo and a weird condition are fixed in msg.c - Thanks again
  varmojfekoj 
- on file creation the file was always owned by root:root. This is fixed
  now - Thanks ypsa for solving this issue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.1 (mmeckelein), 2007-08-22
- a bug that caused a high load when a TCP/UDP connection was closed is 
  fixed now - Thanks mildew for solving this issue
- fixed a bug which caused a segfault on reinit - Thx varmojfekoj for the
  patch
- changed the hardcoded module path "/lib/rsyslog" to $(pkglibdir) in order
  to avoid trouble e.g. on 64 bit platforms (/lib64) - many thanks Peter
  Vrabec and darix, both provided a patch for solving this issue
- enhanced the unloading of modules - thanks again varmojfekoj
- applied a patch from varmojfekoj which fixes various little things in
  MySQL output module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.0 (varmojfekoj/rgerhards), 2007-08-16
- integrated patch from varmojfekoj to make the mysql module a loadable one
  many thanks for the patch, MUCH appreciated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.2 (rgerhards), 2007-08-13
- fixed a bug in outchannel code that caused templates to be incorrectly
  parsed
- fixed a bug in ommysql that caused a wrong ";template" missing message
- added some code for unloading modules; not yet fully complete (and we do
  not yet have loadable modules, so this is no problem)
- removed debian subdirectory by request of a debian packager (this is a special
  subdir for debian and there is also no point in maintaining it when there
  is a debian package available - so I gladly did this) in some cases
- improved overall doc quality (some pages were quite old) and linked to
  more of the online resources.
- improved /contrib/delete_mysql script by adding a host option and some
  other minor modifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.1 (rgerhards), 2007-08-08
- applied a patch from varmojfekoj which solved a potential segfault
  of rsyslogd on HUP
- applied patch from Michel Samia to fix compilation when the pthreads
  feature is disabled
- some code cleanup (moved action object to its own file set)
- add config directive $MainMsgQueueSize, which now allows to configure the
  queue size dynamically
- all compile-time settings are now shown in rsyslogd -v, not just the
  active ones
- enhanced performance a little bit more
- added config file directive $ActionResumeInterval
- fixed a bug that prevented compilation under debian sid
- added a contrib directory for user-contributed useful things
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.0 (rgerhards), 2007-08-03
- rsyslog now supports fallback actions when an action did not work. This
  is a great feature e.g. for backup database servers or backup syslog
  servers
- modified rklogd to only change the console log level if -c is specified
- added feature to use multiple actions inside a single selector
- implemented $ActionExecOnlyWhenPreviousIsSuspended config directive
- error messages during startup are now spit out to the configured log
  destinations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.6 (rgerhards), 2007-08-01
- continued to work on output module modularization - basic stage of
  this work is now FINISHED
- fixed bug in OMSRcreate() - always returned SR_RET_OK
- fixed a bug that caused ommysql to always complain about missing
  templates
- fixed a mem leak in OMSRdestruct - freeing the object itself was
  forgotten - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed a memory leak in syslogd/init() that happend when the config
  file could not be read - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed insufficient memory allocation in addAction() and its helpers.
  The initial fix and idea was developed by mildew, I fine-tuned
  it a bit. Thanks a lot for the fix, I'd probably had pulled out my
  hair to find the bug...
- added output of config file line number when a parsing error occured
- fixed bug in objomsr.c that caused program to abort in debug mode with
  an invalid assertion (in some cases)
- fixed a typo that caused the default template for MySQL to be wrong.
  thanks to mildew for catching this.
- added configuration file command $DebugPrintModuleList and
  $DebugPrintCfSysLineHandlerList
- fixed an invalid value for the MARK timer - unfortunately, there was
  a testing aid left in place. This resulted in quite frequent MARK messages
- added $IncludeConfig config directive
- applied a patch from mildew to prevent rsyslogd from freezing under heavy
  load. This could happen when the queue was full. Now, we drop messages
  but rsyslogd remains active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.5 (rgerhards), 2007-07-30
- continued to work on output module modularization
- fixed a missing file bug - thanks to Andrea Montanari for reporting
  this problem
- fixed a problem with shutting down the worker thread and freeing the
  selector_t list - this caused messages to be lost, because the
  message queue was not properly drained before the selectors got
  destroyed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.4 (rgerhards), 2007-07-27
- continued to work on output module modularization
- fixed a situation where rsyslogd could create zombie processes
  thanks to mildew for the patch
- applied patch from Michel Samia to fix compilation when NOT
  compiled for pthreads
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.3 (rgerhards), 2007-07-25
- continued working on output module modularization
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault on exit (and
  probably also on HUP), when there was an unsent message in a selector
  that required forwarding and the dns lookup failed for that selector
  (yes, it was pretty unlikely to happen;))
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed a memory leak in config file parsing and die()
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- rsyslogd now checks on startup if it is capable to performa any work
  at all. If it cant, it complains and terminates
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- fixed a small memory leak when HUPing syslogd. The allowed sender
  list now gets freed. thanks to mildew for the patch.
- changed the way error messages in early startup are logged. They
  now do no longer use the syslogd code directly but are rather
  send to stderr.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.2 (rgerhards), 2007-07-23
- made the port part of the -r option optional. Needed for backward
  compatibility with sysklogd
- replaced system() calls with something more reasonable. Please note that
  this might break compatibility with some existing configuration files.
  We accept this in favour of the gained security.
- removed a memory leak that could occur if timegenerated was used in
  RFC 3164 format in templates
- did some preparation in msg.c for advanced multithreading - placed the
  hooks, but not yet any active code
- worked further on modularization
- added $ModLoad MySQL (dummy) config directive
- added DropTrailingLFOnReception config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.1 (rgerhards), 2007-07-20
- fixed a bug that caused make install to install rsyslogd and rklogd under
  the wrong names
- fixed bug that caused $AllowedSenders to handle IPv6 scopes incorrectly;
  also fixed but that could grabble $AllowedSender wildcards. Thanks to
  mildew@gmail.com for the patch
- minor code cleanup - thanks to Peter Vrabec for the patch
- fixed minimal memory leak on HUP (caused by templates)
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed another memory leak on HUPing and on exiting rsyslogd
  again thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- code cleanup (removed compiler warnings)
- fixed portability bug in configure.ac - thanks to Bartosz KuÅºma for patch
- moved msg object into its own file set
- added the capability to continue trying to write log files when the
  file system is full. Functionality based on patch by Martin Schulze
  to sysklogd package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.0 (RGer), 2007-07-17
- added $RepeatedLineReduction config parameter
- added $EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive config parameter
- added $ControlCharacterEscapePrefix config parameter
- added $DirCreateMode config parameter
- added $CreateDirs config parameter
- added $DebugPrintTemplateList config parameter
- added $ResetConfigVariables config parameter
- added $FileOwner config parameter
- added $FileGroup config parameter
- added $DirOwner config parameter
- added $DirGroup config parameter
- added $FailOnChownFailure config parameter
- added regular expression support to the filter engine
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- enhanced $AllowedSender functionality. Credits to mildew@gmail.com for
  the patch doing that
  - added IPv6 support
  - allowed DNS hostnames
  - allowed DNS wildcard names
- added new option $DropMsgsWithMaliciousDnsPTRRecords
- added autoconf so that rfc3195d, rsyslogd and klogd are stored to /sbin
- added capability to auto-create directories with dynaFiles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.16.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-07-13 - The Friday, 13th Release ;)
- build system switched to autotools
- removed SYSV preprocessor macro use, replaced with autotools equivalents
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault when TCP listening was
  disabled and it terminated
- added new properties "syslogfacility-text" and "syslogseverity-text"
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- added the -x option to disable hostname dns reslution
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- begun to better modularize syslogd.c - this is an ongoing project; moved
  type definitions to a separate file
- removed some now-unused fields from struct filed
- move file size limit fields in struct field to the "right spot" (the file
  writing part of the union - f_un.f_file)
- subdirectories linux and solaris are no longer part of the distribution
  package. This is not because we cease support for them, but there are no
  longer any files in them after the move to autotools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.1 (RGer), 2007-07-10
- fixed a bug that caused a dynaFile selector to stall when there was
  an open error with one file 
- improved template processing for dynaFiles; templates are now only
  looked up during initialization - speeds up processing
- optimized memory layout in struct filed when compiled with MySQL
  support
- fixed a bug that caused compilation without SYSLOG_INET to fail
- re-enabled the "last message repeated n times" feature. This
  feature was not taken care of while rsyslogd evolved from sysklogd
  and it was more or less defunct. Now it is fully functional again.
- added system properties: $NOW, $YEAR, $MONTH, $DAY, $HOUR, $MINUTE
- fixed a bug in iovAsString() that caused a memory leak under stress
  conditions (most probably memory shortage). This was unlikely to
  ever happen, but it doesn't hurt doing it right
- cosmetic: defined type "uchar", change all unsigned chars to uchar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.0 (RGer), 2007-07-05
- added ability to dynamically generate file names based on templates
  and thus properties. This was a much-requested feature. It makes
  life easy when it e.g. comes to splitting files based on the sender
  address.
- added $umask and $FileCreateMode config file directives
- applied a patch from Bartosz Kuzma to compile cleanly under NetBSD
- checks for extra (unexpected) characters in system config file lines
  have been added
- added IPv6 documentation - was accidently missing from CVS
- begun to change char to unsigned char
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.2 (RGer), 2007-07-03
** this release fixes all known nits with IPv6 **
- restored capability to do /etc/service lookup for "syslog"
  service when -r 0 was given
- documented IPv6 handling of syslog messages
- integrate patch from Bartosz KuÅºma to make rsyslog compile under
  Solaris again (the patch replaced a strndup() call, which is not
  available under Solaris
- improved debug logging when waiting on select
- updated rsyslogd man page with new options (-46A)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.1 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-29
- added Peter Vrabec's patch for IPv6 TCP
- prefixed all messages send to stderr in rsyslogd with "rsyslogd: "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-28
- Peter Vrabec provided IPv6 for rsyslog, so we are now IPv6 enabled
  IPv6 Support is currently for UDP only, TCP is to come soon.
  AllowedSender configuration does not yet work for IPv6.
- fixed code in iovCreate() that broke C's strict aliasing rules 
- fixed some char/unsigned char differences that forced the compiler
  to spit out warning messages
- updated the Red Hat init script to fix a known issue (thanks to
  Peter Vrabec)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.5 (RGer), 2007-06-22
- made the TCP session limit configurable via command line switch
  now -t <port>,<max sessions>
- added man page for rklogd(8) (basically a copy from klogd, but now
  there is one...)
- fixed a bug that caused internal messages (e.g. rsyslogd startup) to
  appear without a tag.
- removed a minor memory leak that occurred when TAG processing requalified
  a HOSTNAME to be a TAG (and a TAG already was set).
- removed potential small memory leaks in MsgSet***() functions. There
  would be a leak if a property was re-set, something that happened
  extremely seldom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.4 (RGer), 2007-06-18
- added a new property "PRI-text", which holds the PRI field in
  textual form (e.g. "syslog.info")
- added alias "syslogseverity" for "syslogpriority", which is a
  misleading property name that needs to stay for historical
  reasons (and backward-compatility)
- added doc on how to record PRI value in log file
- enhanced signal handling in klogd, including removal of an unsafe
  call to the logging system during signal handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.3 (RGer), 2007-06-15
- create a version of syslog.c from scratch. This is now
  - highly optimized for rsyslog
  - removes an incompatible license problem as the original
    version had a BSD license with advertising clause
  - fixed in the regard that rklogd will continue to work when
    rsysogd has been restarted (the original version, as well
    as sysklogd, will remain silent then)
  - solved an issue with an extra NUL char at message end that the
    original version had
- applied some changes to klogd to care for the new interface
- fixed a bug in syslogd.c which prevented compiling under debian
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.2 (RGer), 2007-06-13
- lib order in makefile patched to facilitate static linking - thanks
  to Bennett Todd for providing the patch
- Integrated a patch from Peter Vrabec (pvrabec@redheat.com):
  - added klogd under the name of rklogd (remove dependency on
    original sysklogd package
  - createDB.sql now in UTF
  - added additional config files for use on Red Hat
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.1 (RGer), 2007-02-05
- changed the listen backlog limit to a more reasonable value based on
  the maximum number of TCP connections configurd (10% + 5) - thanks to Guy
  Standen for the hint (actually, the limit was 5 and that was a 
  left-over from early testing).
- fixed a bug in makefile which caused DB-support to be disabled when
  NETZIP support was enabled
- added the -e option to allow transmission of every message to remote
  hosts (effectively turns off duplicate message suppression)
- (somewhat) improved memory consumption when compiled with MySQL support
- looks like we fixed an incompatibility with MySQL 5.x and above software
  At least in one case, the remote server name was destroyed, leading to 
  a connection failure. The new, improved code does not have this issue and
  so we see this as solved (the new code is generally somewhat better, so
  there is a good chance we fixed this incompatibility).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.0 (RGer), 2006-12-19
- added '$' as ToPos proptery replacer specifier - means "up to the
  end of the string"
- property replacer option "escape-cc", "drop-cc" and "space-cc"  added
- changed the handling of \0 characters inside syslog messages. We now
  consistently escape them to "#000". This is somewhat recommended in
  the draft-ietf-syslog-protocol-19 draft. While the real recomendation
  is to not escape any characters at all, we can not do this without
  considerable modification of the code. So we escape it to "#000", which
  is consistent with a sample found in the Internet-draft.
- removed message glue logic (see printchopped() comment for details)
  Also caused removal of parts table and thus some improvements in
  memory usage.
- changed the default MAXLINE to 2048 to take care of recent syslog
  standardization efforts (can easily be changed in syslogd.c)
- added support for byte-counted TCP syslog messages (much like
  syslog-transport-tls-05 Internet Draft). This was necessary to
  support compression over TCP.
- added support for receiving compressed syslog messages
- added support for sending compressed syslog messages
- fixed a bug where the last message in a syslog/tcp stream was
  lost if it was not properly terminated by a LF character
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.3 (RGer), 2006-10-04
- implemented some changes to support Solaris (but support is not
  yet complete)
- commented out (via #if 0) some methods that are currently not being use
  but should be kept for further us
- added (interim) -u 1 option to turn off hostname and tag parsing
- done some modifications to better support Fedora
- made the field delimiter inside property replace configurable via
  template
- fixed a bug in property replacer: if fields were used, the delimitor
  became part of the field. Up until now, this was barely noticable as 
  the delimiter as TAB only and thus invisible to a human. With other
  delimiters available now, it quickly showed up. This bug fix might cause
  some grief to existing installations if they used the extra TAB for
  whatever reasons - sorry folks... Anyhow, a solution is easy: just add
  a TAB character contstant into your template. Thus, there has no attempt
  been made to do this in a backwards-compatible way.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.2 (RGer), 2006-02-15
- fixed a bug in the RFC 3339 date formatter. An extra space was added
  after the actual timestamp
- added support for providing high-precision RFC3339 timestamps for
  (rsyslogd-)internally-generated messages
- very (!) experimental support for syslog-protocol internet draft
  added (the draft is experimental, the code is solid ;))
- added support for field-extracting in the property replacer
- enhanced the legacy-syslog parser so that it can interpret messages
  that do not contain a TIMESTAMP
- fixed a bug that caused the default socket (usually /dev/log) to be
  opened even when -o command line option was given
- fixed a bug in the Debian sample startup script - it caused rsyslogd
  to listen to remote requests, which it shouldn't by default
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.1 (RGer), 2005-11-23
- made multithreading work with BSD. Some signal-handling needed to be
  restructured. Also, there might be a slight delay of up to 10 seconds
  when huping and terminating rsyslogd under BSD
- fixed a bug where a NULL-pointer was passed to printf() in logmsg().
- fixed a bug during "make install" where rc3195d was not installed
  Thanks to Bennett Todd for spotting this.
- fixed a bug where rsyslogd dumped core when no TAG was found in the
  received message
- enhanced message parser so that it can deal with missing hostnames
  in many cases (may not be totally fail-safe)
- fixed a bug where internally-generated messages did not have the correct
  TAG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.0 (RGer), 2005-10-26
- moved to a multi-threaded design. single-threading is still optionally
  available. Multi-threading is experimental!
- fixed a potential race condition. In the original code, marking was done
  by an alarm handler, which could lead to all sorts of bad things. This
  has been changed now. See comments in syslogd.c/domark() for details.
- improved debug output for property-based filters
- not a code change, but: I have checked all exit()s to make sure that
  none occurs once rsyslogd has started up. Even in unusual conditions
  (like low-memory conditions) rsyslogd somehow remains active. Of course,
  it might loose a message or two, but at least it does not abort and it
  can also recover when the condition no longer persists.
- fixed a bug that could cause loss of the last message received
  immediately before rsyslogd was terminated.
- added comments on thread-safety of global variables in syslogd.c
- fixed a small bug: spurios printf() when TCP syslog was used
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug with regular expression support (thanks to Andres Riancho)
- a little bit of code restructuring (especially main(), which was
  horribly large)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.1 (RGer), 2005-10-19
- support for BSD-style program name and host blocks
- added a new property "programname" that can be used in templates
- added ability to specify listen port for rfc3195d
- fixed a bug that rendered the "startswith" comparison operation
  unusable.
- changed more functions to "static" storage class to help compiler
  optimize (should have been static in the first place...)
- fixed a potential memory leak in the string buffer class destructor.
  As the destructur was previously never called, the leak did not actually
  appear.
- some internal restructuring in anticipation/preparation of minimal
  multi-threading support
- rsyslogd still shares some code with the sysklogd project. Some patches
  for this shared code have been brought over from the sysklogd CVS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.0 (RGer), 2005-10-12
- support for receiving messages via RFC 3195; added rfc3195d for that
  purpose
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.2 (RGer), 2005-09-27
- added comparison operations in property-based filters:
  * isequal
  * startswith
- added ability to negate all property-based filter comparison operations
  by adding a !-sign right in front of the operation name
- added the ability to specify remote senders for UDP and TCP
  received messages. Allows to block all but well-known hosts
- changed the $-config line directives to be case-INsensitive
- new command line option -w added: "do not display warnings if messages
  from disallowed senders are received"
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to dump core when the compare value
  was not quoted in property-based filters
- fixed a bug in the new CStr compare function which lead to invalid
  results (fortunately, this function was not yet used widely)
- added better support for "debugging" rsyslog.conf property filters
  (only if -d switch is given)
- changed some function definitions to static, which eventually enables
  some compiler optimizations
- fixed a bug in MySQL code; when a SQL error occured, rsyslogd could
  run in a tight loop. This was due to invalid sequence of error reporting
  and is now fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- added the ability to execute a shell script as an action.
  Thanks to Bjoern Kalkbrenner for providing the code!
- fixed a bug in the MySQL code; due to the bug the automatic one-time
  retry after an error did not happen - this lead to error message in
  cases where none should be seen (e.g. after a MySQL restart)
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.0 (RGer), 2005-09-20
  REMINDER: 1.10 is the first unstable version if the 1.x series!
- added the capability to filter on any property in selector lines
  (not just facility and priority)
- changed stringbuf into a new counted string class
- added support for a "discard" action. If a selector line with
  discard (~ character) is found, no selector lines *after* that
  line will be processed.
- thanks to Andres Riancho, regular expression support has been
  added to the template engine
- added the FROMHOST property in the template processor, which could
  previously not be obtained. Thanks to Cristian Testa for pointing
  this out and even providing a fix.
- added display of compile-time options to -v output
- performance improvement for production build - made some checks
  to happen only during debug mode
- fixed a problem with compiling on SUSE and - while doing so - removed
  the socket call to set SO_BSDCOMPAT in cases where it is obsolete.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.4 (RGer), 2006-02-01
- a small but important fix: the tcp receiver had two forgotten printf's
  in it that caused a lot of unnecessary output to stdout. This was
  important enough to justify a new release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.3 (RGer), 2005-11-14
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
- applied some patches available from the sysklogd project to code
  shared from there
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug in the TCP sender that caused the retry logic to fail
  after an error or receiver overrun
- fixed a bug in init() that could lead to dumping core
- fixed a bug that could lead to dumping core when no HOSTNAME or no TAG
  was present in the syslog message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.2 (RGer), 2005-10-05
- fixed an issue with MySQL error reporting. When an error occured,
  the MySQL driver went into an endless loop (at least in most cases).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (RGer), 2005-09-12
- changed install doc to cover daily cron scripts - a trouble source
- added rc script for slackware (provided by Chris Elvidge - thanks!) 
- fixed a really minor bug in usage() - the -r option was still
  reported as without the port parameter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.8 (RGer), 2005-09-05
- made startup and shutdown message more consistent and included the
  pid, so that they can be easier correlated. Used syslog-protocol
  structured data format for this purpose.
- improved config info in startup message, now tells not only
  if it is listening remote on udp, but also for tcp. Also includes
  the port numbers. The previous startup message was misleading, because
  it did not say "remote reception" if rsyslogd was only listening via
  tcp (but not via udp).
- added a "how can you help" document to the doc set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.7 (RGer), 2005-08-15
- some of the previous doc files (like INSTALL) did not properly
  reflect the changes to the build process and the new doc. Fixed
  that.
- changed syslogd.c so that when compiled without database support,
  an error message is displayed when a database action is detected
  in the config file (previously this was used as an user rule ;))
- fixed a bug in the os-specific Makefiles which caused MySQL
  support to not be compiled, even if selected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.6 (RGer), 2005-08-09
- greatly enhanced documentation. Now available in html format in
  the "doc" folder and FreeBSD. Finally includes an install howto.
- improved MySQL error messages a little - they now show up as log
  messages, too (formerly only in debug mode)
- added the ability to specify the listen port for udp syslog.
  WARNING: This introduces an incompatibility. Formerly, udp
  syslog was enabled by the -r command line option. Now, it is
  "-r [port]", which is consistent with the tcp listener. However,
  just -r will now return an error message.
- added sample startup scripts for Debian and FreeBSD
- added support for easy feature selection in the makefile. Un-
  fortunately, this also means I needed to spilt the make file
  for different OS and distros. There are some really bad syntax
  differences between FreeBSD and Linux make.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.5 (RGer), 2005-08-01
- the "semicolon bug" was actually not (fully) solved in 0.9.4. One
  part of the bug was solved, but another still existed. This one
  is fixed now, too.
- the "semicolon bug" actually turned out to be a more generic bug.
  It appeared whenever an invalid template name was given. With some
  selector actions, rsyslogd dumped core, with other it "just" had
  a small ressource leak with others all worked well. These anomalies
  are now fixed. Note that they only appeared during system initaliziation
  once the system was running, nothing bad happened.
- improved error reporting for template errors on startup. They are now
  shown on the console and the start-up tty. Formerly, they were only
  visible in debug mode.
- support for multiple instances of rsyslogd on a single machine added
- added new option "-o" --> omit local unix domain socket. This option
  enables rsyslogd NOT to listen to the local socket. This is most
  helpful when multiple instances of rsyslogd (or rsyslogd and another
  syslogd) shall run on a single system.
- added new option "-i <pidfile>" which allows to specify the pidfile.
  This is needed when multiple instances of rsyslogd are to be run.
- the new project home page is now online at www.rsyslog.com
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.4 (RGer), 2005-07-25
- finally added the TCP sender. It now supports non-blocking mode, no
  longer disabling message reception during connect. As it is now, it
  is usable in production. The code could be more sophisticated, but
  I've kept it short in anticipation of the move to liblogging, which
  will lead to the removal of the code just written ;)
- the "exiting on signal..." message still had the "syslogd" name in 
  it. Changed this to "rsyslogd", as we do not have a large user base
  yet, this should pose no problem.
- fixed "the semiconlon" bug. rsyslogd dumped core if a write-db action
  was specified but no semicolon was given after the password (an empty
  template was ok, but the semicolon needed to be present).
- changed a default for traditional output format. During testing, it
  was seen that the timestamp written to file in default format was
  the time of message reception, not the time specified in the TIMESTAMP
  field of the message itself. Traditionally, the message TIMESTAMP is
  used and this has been changed now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.3 (RGer), 2005-07-19
- fixed a bug in the message parser. In June, the RFC 3164 timestamp
  was not correctly parsed (yes, only in June and some other months,
  see the code comment to learn why...)
- added the ability to specify the destination port when forwarding
  syslog messages (both for TCP and UDP)
- added an very experimental TCP sender (activated by
  @@machine:port in config). This is not yet for production use. If
  the receiver is not alive, rsyslogd will wait quite some time until
  the connection request times out, which most probably leads to
  loss of incoming messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.2 (RGer), around 2005-07-06
- I intended to change the maxsupported message size to 32k to
  support IHE - but given the memory inefficiency in the usual use
  cases, I have not done this. I have, however, included very
  specific instructions on how to do this in the source code. I have
  also done some testing with 32k messages, so you can change the
  max size without taking too much risk.
- added a syslog/tcp receiver; we now can receive messages via
  plain tcp, but we can still send only via UDP. The syslog/tcp
  receiver is the primary enhancement of this release.
- slightly changed some error messages that contained a spurios \n at
  the end of the line (which gives empty lines in your log...)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.1 (RGer)
- fixed code so that it compiles without errors under FreeBSD
- removed now unused function "allocate_log()" from syslogd.c
- changed the make file so that it contains more defines for
  different environments (in the long term, we need a better
  system for disabling/enabling features...)
- changed some printf's printing off_t types to %lld and
  explicit (long long) casts. I tried to figure out the exact type,
  but did not succeed in this. In the worst case, ultra-large peta-
  byte files will now display funny informational messages on rollover,
  something I think we can live with for the neersion 3.11.2 (rgerhards), 2008-02-??
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.1 (rgerhards), 2008-02-12
- SNMP trap sender added thanks to Andre Lorbach (omsnmp)
- added input-plugin interface specification in form of a (copy) template
  input module
- applied documentation fix by Michael Biebl -- many thanks!
- bugfix: immark did not have MARK flags set...
- added x-info field to rsyslogd startup/shutdown message. Hopefully
  points users to right location for further info (many don't even know
  they run rsyslog ;))
- bugfix: trailing ":" of tag was lost while parsing legacy syslog messages
  without timestamp - thanks to Anders Blomdell for providing a patch!
- fixed a bug in stringbuf.c related to STRINGBUF_TRIM_ALLOCSIZE, which
  wasn't supposed to be used with rsyslog. Put a warning message up that
  tells this feature is not tested and probably not worth the effort.
  Thanks to Anders Blomdell fro bringing this to our attention
- somewhat improved performance of string buffers
- fixed bug that caused invalid treatment of tabs (HT) in rsyslog.conf
- bugfix: setting for $EscapeCopntrolCharactersOnReceive was not 
  properly initialized
- clarified usage of space-cc property replacer option
- improved abort diagnostic handler
- some initial effort for malloc/free runtime debugging support
- bugfix: using dynafile actions caused rsyslogd abort
- fixed minor man errors thanks to Michael Biebl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.11.0 (rgerhards), 2008-01-31
- implemented queued actions
- implemented simple rate limiting for actions
- implemented deliberate discarding of lower priority messages over higher
  priority ones when a queue runs out of space
- implemented disk quotas for disk queues
- implemented the $ActionResumeRetryCount config directive
- added $ActionQueueFilename config directive
- added $ActionQueueSize config directive
- added $ActionQueueHighWaterMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueLowWaterMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueDiscardMark config directive
- added $ActionQueueDiscardSeverity config directive
- added $ActionQueueCheckpointInterval config directive
- added $ActionQueueType config directive
- added $ActionQueueWorkerThreads config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutshutdown config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutActionCompletion config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutenQueue config directive
- added $ActionQueueTimeoutworkerThreadShutdown config directive
- added $ActionQueueWorkerThreadMinimumMessages config directive
- added $ActionQueueMaxFileSize config directive
- added $ActionQueueSaveonShutdown config directive
- addded $ActionQueueDequeueSlowdown config directive
- addded $MainMsgQueueDequeueSlowdown config directive
- bugfix: added forgotten docs to package
- improved debugging support
- fixed a bug that caused $MainMsgQueueCheckpointInterval to work incorrectly
- when a long-running action needs to be cancelled on shutdown, the message
  that was processed by it is now preserved. This finishes support for
  guaranteed delivery of messages (if the output supports it, of course)
- fixed bug in output module interface, see
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1881008&group_id=123448&atid=696552
- changed the ommysql output plugin so that the (lengthy) connection
  initialization now takes place in message processing. This works much
  better with the new queued action mode (fast startup)
- fixed a bug that caused a potential hang in file and fwd output module
  varmojfekoj provided the patch - many thanks!
- bugfixed stream class offset handling on 32bit platforms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.3 (rgerhards), 2008-01-28
- fixed a bug with standard template definitions (not a big deal) - thanks
  to varmojfekoj for spotting it
- run-time instrumentation added
- implemented disk-assisted queue mode, which enables on-demand disk
  spooling if the queue's in-memory queue is exhausted
- implemented a dynamic worker thread pool for processing incoming
  messages; workers are started and shut down as need arises
- implemented a run-time instrumentation debug package
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueSaveOnShutdown config directive
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueWorkerThreadMinimumMessages config directive
- implemented the $MainMsgQueueTimeoutWorkerThreadShutdown config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.2 (rgerhards), 2008-01-14
- added the ability to keep stop rsyslogd without the need to drain
  the main message queue. In disk queue mode, rsyslog continues to
  run from the point where it stopped. In case of a system failure, it
  continues to process messages from the last checkpoint.
- fixed a bug that caused a segfault on startup when no $WorkDir directive
  was specified in rsyslog.conf
- provided more fine-grain control over shutdown timeouts and added a
  way to specify the enqueue timeout when the main message queue is full
- implemented $MainMsgQueueCheckpointInterval config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutActionCompletion config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutEnqueue config directive
- implemented $MainMsgQueueTimeoutShutdown config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.1 (rgerhards), 2008-01-10
- implemented the "disk" queue mode. However, it currently is of very
  limited use, because it does not support persistence over rsyslogd
  runs. So when rsyslogd is stopped, the queue is drained just as with
  the in-memory queue modes. Persistent queues will be a feature of
  the next release.
- performance-optimized string class, should bring an overall improvement
- fixed a memory leak in imudp -- thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed a race condition that could lead to a rsyslogd hang when during
  HUP or termination
- done some doc updates
- added $WorkDirectory config directive
- added $MainMsgQueueFileName config directive
- added $MainMsgQueueMaxFileSize config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.10.0 (rgerhards), 2008-01-07
- implemented input module interface and initial input modules
- enhanced threading for input modules (each on its own thread now)
- ability to bind UDP listeners to specific local interfaces/ports and
  ability to run multiple of them concurrently
- added ability to specify listen IP address for UDP syslog server
- license changed to GPLv3
- mark messages are now provided by loadble module immark
- rklogd is no longer provided. Its functionality has now been taken over
  by imklog, a loadable input module. This offers a much better integration
  into rsyslogd and makes sure that the kernel logger process is brought
  up and down at the appropriate times
- enhanced $IncludeConfig directive to support wildcard characters
  (thanks to Michael Biebl)
- all inputs are now implemented as loadable plugins
- enhanced threading model: each input module now runs on its own thread
- enhanced message queue which now supports different queueing methods
  (among others, this can be used for performance fine-tuning)
- added a large number of new configuration directives for the new
  input modules
- enhanced multi-threading utilizing a worker thread pool for the
  main message queue
- compilation without pthreads is no longer supported
- much cleaner code due to new objects and removal of single-threading
  mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.1 STABLE (rgerhards), 2008-01-24
- fixed a bug in integer conversion - but this function was never called,
  so it is not really a useful bug fix ;)
- fixed a bug with standard template definitions (not a big deal) - thanks
  to varmojfekoj for spotting it
- fixed a bug that caused a potential hang in file and fwd output module
  varmojfekoj provided the patch - many thanks!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.0 STABLE (rgerhards), 2008-01-02
- re-release of 1.21.2 as STABLE with no modifications except some
  doc updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.2 (rgerhards), 2007-12-28
- created a gss-api output module. This keeps GSS-API code and
  TCP/UDP code separated. It is also important for forward-
  compatibility with v3. Please note that this change breaks compatibility
  with config files created for 1.21.0 and 1.21.1 - this was considered
  acceptable.
- fixed an error in forwarding retry code (could lead to message corruption
  but surfaced very seldom)
- increased portability for older platforms (AI_NUMERICSERV moved)
- removed socket leak in omfwd.c
- cross-platform patch for GSS-API compile problem on some platforms
  thanks to darix for the patch!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.1 (rgerhards), 2007-12-23
- small doc fix for $IncludeConfig
- fixed a bug in llDestroy()
- bugfix: fixing memory leak when message queue is full and during
  parsing. Thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch.
- bugfix: when compiled without network support, unix sockets were
  not properply closed
- bugfix: memory leak in cfsysline.c/doGetWord() fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21.0 (rgerhards), 2007-12-19
- GSS-API support for syslog/TCP connections was added. Thanks to
  varmojfekoj for providing the patch with this functionality
- code cleanup
- enhanced $IncludeConfig directive to support wildcard filenames
- changed some multithreading synchronization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20.1 (rgerhards), 2007-12-12
- corrected a debug setting that survived release. Caused TCP connections
  to be retried unnecessarily often.
- When a hostname ACL was provided and DNS resolution for that name failed,
  ACL processing was stopped at that point. Thanks to mildew for the patch.
  Fedora Bugzilla: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=395911
- fixed a potential race condition, see link for details:
  http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/12/rsyslog-race-condition.html
  Note that the probability of problems from this bug was very remote
- fixed a memory leak that happend when PostgreSQL date formats were
  used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20.0 (rgerhards), 2007-12-07
- an output module for postgres databases has been added. Thanks to
  sur5r for contributing this code
- unloading dynamic modules has been cleaned up, we now have a
  real implementation and not just a dummy "good enough for the time
  being".
- enhanced platform independence - thanks to Bartosz Kuzma and Michael
  Biebl for their very useful contributions
- some general code cleanup (including warnings on 64 platforms, only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.12 (rgerhards), 2007-12-03
- cleaned up the build system (thanks to Michael Biebl for the patch)
- fixed a bug where ommysql was still not compiled with -pthread option
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.11 (rgerhards), 2007-11-29
- applied -pthread option to build when building for multi-threading mode
  hopefully solves an issue with segfaulting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.10 (rgerhards), 2007-10-19
- introdcued the new ":modulename:" syntax for calling module actions
  in selector lines; modified ommysql to support it. This is primarily
  an aid for further modules and a prequisite to actually allow third
  party modules to be created.
- minor fix in slackware startup script, "-r 0" is now "-r0"
- updated rsyslogd doc set man page; now in html format
- undid creation of a separate thread for the main loop -- this did not
  turn out to be needed or useful, so reduce complexity once again.
- added doc fixes provided by Michael Biebl - thanks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.9 (rgerhards), 2007-10-12
- now packaging system which again contains all components in a single
  tarball
- modularized main() a bit more, resulting in less complex code
- experimentally added an additional thread - will see if that affects
  the segfault bug we experience on some platforms. Note that this change
  is scheduled to be removed again later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.8 (rgerhards), 2007-09-27
- improved repeated message processing
- applied patch provided by varmojfekoj to support building ommysql
  in its own way (now also resides in a plugin subdirectory);
  ommysql is now a separate package
- fixed a bug in cvthname() that lead to message loss if part
  of the source hostname would have been dropped
- created some support for distributing ommysql together with the
  main rsyslog package. I need to re-think it in the future, but
  for the time being the current mode is best. I now simply include
  one additional tarball for ommysql inside the main distribution.
  I look forward to user feedback on how this should be done best. In the
  long term, a separate project should be spawend for ommysql, but I'd
  like to do that only after the plugin interface is fully stable (what
  it is not yet).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.7 (rgerhards), 2007-09-25
- added code to handle situations where senders send us messages ending with
  a NUL character. It is now simply removed. This also caused trailing LF
  reduction to fail, when it was followed by such a NUL. This is now also
  handled.
- replaced some non-thread-safe function calls by their thread-safe
  counterparts
- fixed a minor memory leak that occured when the %APPNAME% property was
  used (I think nobody used that in practice)
- fixed a bug that caused signal handlers in cvthname() not to be restored when
  a malicious pointer record was detected and processing of the message been
  stopped for that reason (this should be really rare and can not be related
  to the segfault bug we are hunting).
- fixed a bug in cvthname that lead to passing a wrong parameter - in
  practice, this had no impact.
- general code cleanup (e.g. compiler warnings, comments)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.6 (rgerhards), 2007-09-11
- applied patch by varmojfekoj to change signal handling to the new
  sigaction API set (replacing the depreciated signal() calls and its
  friends.
- fixed a bug that in --enable-debug mode caused an assertion when the
  discard action was used
- cleaned up compiler warnings
- applied patch by varmojfekoj to FIX a bug that could cause 
  segfaults if empty properties were processed using modifying
  options (e.g. space-cc, drop-cc)
- fixed man bug: rsyslogd supports -l option
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.5 (rgerhards), 2007-09-07
- changed part of the CStr interface so that better error tracking
  is provided and the calling sequence is more intuitive (there were
  invalid calls based on a too-weired interface)
- (hopefully) fixed some remaining bugs rooted in wrong use of 
  the CStr class. These could lead to program abort.
- applied patch by varmojfekoj two fix two potential segfault situations
- added $ModDir config directive
- modified $ModLoad so that an absolute path may be specified as
  module name (e.g. /rsyslog/ommysql.so)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.4 (rgerhards/varmojfekoj), 2007-09-04
- fixed a number of small memory leaks - thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- fixed an issue with CString class that could lead to rsyslog abort
  in tplToString() - thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- added a man-version of the config file documenation - thanks to Michel
  Samia for providing the man file
- fixed bug: a template like this causes an infinite loop:
  $template opts,"%programname:::a,b%"
  thanks varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed bug: case changing options crash freeing the string pointer
  because they modify it: $template opts2,"%programname::1:lowercase%"
  thanks varmojfekoj for the patch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.3 (mmeckelein/varmojfekoj), 2007-08-31
- small mem leak fixed (after calling parseSelectorAct) - Thx varmojkekoj
- documentation section "Regular File" und "Blocks" updated
- solved an issue with dynamic file generation - Once again many thanks
  to varmojfekoj
- the negative selector for program name filter (Blocks) does not work as
  expected - Thanks varmojfekoj for patching
- added forwarding information to sysklogd (requires special template)
  to config doc
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.2 (mmeckelein/varmojfekoj), 2007-08-28
- a specifically formed message caused a segfault - Many thanks varmojfekoj
  for providing a patch
- a typo and a weird condition are fixed in msg.c - Thanks again
  varmojfekoj 
- on file creation the file was always owned by root:root. This is fixed
  now - Thanks ypsa for solving this issue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.1 (mmeckelein), 2007-08-22
- a bug that caused a high load when a TCP/UDP connection was closed is 
  fixed now - Thanks mildew for solving this issue
- fixed a bug which caused a segfault on reinit - Thx varmojfekoj for the
  patch
- changed the hardcoded module path "/lib/rsyslog" to $(pkglibdir) in order
  to avoid trouble e.g. on 64 bit platforms (/lib64) - many thanks Peter
  Vrabec and darix, both provided a patch for solving this issue
- enhanced the unloading of modules - thanks again varmojfekoj
- applied a patch from varmojfekoj which fixes various little things in
  MySQL output module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19.0 (varmojfekoj/rgerhards), 2007-08-16
- integrated patch from varmojfekoj to make the mysql module a loadable one
  many thanks for the patch, MUCH appreciated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.2 (rgerhards), 2007-08-13
- fixed a bug in outchannel code that caused templates to be incorrectly
  parsed
- fixed a bug in ommysql that caused a wrong ";template" missing message
- added some code for unloading modules; not yet fully complete (and we do
  not yet have loadable modules, so this is no problem)
- removed debian subdirectory by request of a debian packager (this is a special
  subdir for debian and there is also no point in maintaining it when there
  is a debian package available - so I gladly did this) in some cases
- improved overall doc quality (some pages were quite old) and linked to
  more of the online resources.
- improved /contrib/delete_mysql script by adding a host option and some
  other minor modifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.1 (rgerhards), 2007-08-08
- applied a patch from varmojfekoj which solved a potential segfault
  of rsyslogd on HUP
- applied patch from Michel Samia to fix compilation when the pthreads
  feature is disabled
- some code cleanup (moved action object to its own file set)
- add config directive $MainMsgQueueSize, which now allows to configure the
  queue size dynamically
- all compile-time settings are now shown in rsyslogd -v, not just the
  active ones
- enhanced performance a little bit more
- added config file directive $ActionResumeInterval
- fixed a bug that prevented compilation under debian sid
- added a contrib directory for user-contributed useful things
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18.0 (rgerhards), 2007-08-03
- rsyslog now supports fallback actions when an action did not work. This
  is a great feature e.g. for backup database servers or backup syslog
  servers
- modified rklogd to only change the console log level if -c is specified
- added feature to use multiple actions inside a single selector
- implemented $ActionExecOnlyWhenPreviousIsSuspended config directive
- error messages during startup are now spit out to the configured log
  destinations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.6 (rgerhards), 2007-08-01
- continued to work on output module modularization - basic stage of
  this work is now FINISHED
- fixed bug in OMSRcreate() - always returned SR_RET_OK
- fixed a bug that caused ommysql to always complain about missing
  templates
- fixed a mem leak in OMSRdestruct - freeing the object itself was
  forgotten - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed a memory leak in syslogd/init() that happend when the config
  file could not be read - thanks to varmojfekoj for the patch
- fixed insufficient memory allocation in addAction() and its helpers.
  The initial fix and idea was developed by mildew, I fine-tuned
  it a bit. Thanks a lot for the fix, I'd probably had pulled out my
  hair to find the bug...
- added output of config file line number when a parsing error occured
- fixed bug in objomsr.c that caused program to abort in debug mode with
  an invalid assertion (in some cases)
- fixed a typo that caused the default template for MySQL to be wrong.
  thanks to mildew for catching this.
- added configuration file command $DebugPrintModuleList and
  $DebugPrintCfSysLineHandlerList
- fixed an invalid value for the MARK timer - unfortunately, there was
  a testing aid left in place. This resulted in quite frequent MARK messages
- added $IncludeConfig config directive
- applied a patch from mildew to prevent rsyslogd from freezing under heavy
  load. This could happen when the queue was full. Now, we drop messages
  but rsyslogd remains active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.5 (rgerhards), 2007-07-30
- continued to work on output module modularization
- fixed a missing file bug - thanks to Andrea Montanari for reporting
  this problem
- fixed a problem with shutting down the worker thread and freeing the
  selector_t list - this caused messages to be lost, because the
  message queue was not properly drained before the selectors got
  destroyed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.4 (rgerhards), 2007-07-27
- continued to work on output module modularization
- fixed a situation where rsyslogd could create zombie processes
  thanks to mildew for the patch
- applied patch from Michel Samia to fix compilation when NOT
  compiled for pthreads
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.3 (rgerhards), 2007-07-25
- continued working on output module modularization
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault on exit (and
  probably also on HUP), when there was an unsent message in a selector
  that required forwarding and the dns lookup failed for that selector
  (yes, it was pretty unlikely to happen;))
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed a memory leak in config file parsing and die()
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- rsyslogd now checks on startup if it is capable to performa any work
  at all. If it cant, it complains and terminates
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- fixed a small memory leak when HUPing syslogd. The allowed sender
  list now gets freed. thanks to mildew for the patch.
- changed the way error messages in early startup are logged. They
  now do no longer use the syslogd code directly but are rather
  send to stderr.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.2 (rgerhards), 2007-07-23
- made the port part of the -r option optional. Needed for backward
  compatibility with sysklogd
- replaced system() calls with something more reasonable. Please note that
  this might break compatibility with some existing configuration files.
  We accept this in favour of the gained security.
- removed a memory leak that could occur if timegenerated was used in
  RFC 3164 format in templates
- did some preparation in msg.c for advanced multithreading - placed the
  hooks, but not yet any active code
- worked further on modularization
- added $ModLoad MySQL (dummy) config directive
- added DropTrailingLFOnReception config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.1 (rgerhards), 2007-07-20
- fixed a bug that caused make install to install rsyslogd and rklogd under
  the wrong names
- fixed bug that caused $AllowedSenders to handle IPv6 scopes incorrectly;
  also fixed but that could grabble $AllowedSender wildcards. Thanks to
  mildew@gmail.com for the patch
- minor code cleanup - thanks to Peter Vrabec for the patch
- fixed minimal memory leak on HUP (caused by templates)
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed another memory leak on HUPing and on exiting rsyslogd
  again thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- code cleanup (removed compiler warnings)
- fixed portability bug in configure.ac - thanks to Bartosz KuÅºma for patch
- moved msg object into its own file set
- added the capability to continue trying to write log files when the
  file system is full. Functionality based on patch by Martin Schulze
  to sysklogd package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.0 (RGer), 2007-07-17
- added $RepeatedLineReduction config parameter
- added $EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive config parameter
- added $ControlCharacterEscapePrefix config parameter
- added $DirCreateMode config parameter
- added $CreateDirs config parameter
- added $DebugPrintTemplateList config parameter
- added $ResetConfigVariables config parameter
- added $FileOwner config parameter
- added $FileGroup config parameter
- added $DirOwner config parameter
- added $DirGroup config parameter
- added $FailOnChownFailure config parameter
- added regular expression support to the filter engine
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- enhanced $AllowedSender functionality. Credits to mildew@gmail.com for
  the patch doing that
  - added IPv6 support
  - allowed DNS hostnames
  - allowed DNS wildcard names
- added new option $DropMsgsWithMaliciousDnsPTRRecords
- added autoconf so that rfc3195d, rsyslogd and klogd are stored to /sbin
- added capability to auto-create directories with dynaFiles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.16.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-07-13 - The Friday, 13th Release ;)
- build system switched to autotools
- removed SYSV preprocessor macro use, replaced with autotools equivalents
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault when TCP listening was
  disabled and it terminated
- added new properties "syslogfacility-text" and "syslogseverity-text"
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- added the -x option to disable hostname dns reslution
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- begun to better modularize syslogd.c - this is an ongoing project; moved
  type definitions to a separate file
- removed some now-unused fields from struct filed
- move file size limit fields in struct field to the "right spot" (the file
  writing part of the union - f_un.f_file)
- subdirectories linux and solaris are no longer part of the distribution
  package. This is not because we cease support for them, but there are no
  longer any files in them after the move to autotools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.1 (RGer), 2007-07-10
- fixed a bug that caused a dynaFile selector to stall when there was
  an open error with one file 
- improved template processing for dynaFiles; templates are now only
  looked up during initialization - speeds up processing
- optimized memory layout in struct filed when compiled with MySQL
  support
- fixed a bug that caused compilation without SYSLOG_INET to fail
- re-enabled the "last message repeated n times" feature. This
  feature was not taken care of while rsyslogd evolved from sysklogd
  and it was more or less defunct. Now it is fully functional again.
- added system properties: $NOW, $YEAR, $MONTH, $DAY, $HOUR, $MINUTE
- fixed a bug in iovAsString() that caused a memory leak under stress
  conditions (most probably memory shortage). This was unlikely to
  ever happen, but it doesn't hurt doing it right
- cosmetic: defined type "uchar", change all unsigned chars to uchar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.0 (RGer), 2007-07-05
- added ability to dynamically generate file names based on templates
  and thus properties. This was a much-requested feature. It makes
  life easy when it e.g. comes to splitting files based on the sender
  address.
- added $umask and $FileCreateMode config file directives
- applied a patch from Bartosz Kuzma to compile cleanly under NetBSD
- checks for extra (unexpected) characters in system config file lines
  have been added
- added IPv6 documentation - was accidently missing from CVS
- begun to change char to unsigned char
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.2 (RGer), 2007-07-03
** this release fixes all known nits with IPv6 **
- restored capability to do /etc/service lookup for "syslog"
  service when -r 0 was given
- documented IPv6 handling of syslog messages
- integrate patch from Bartosz KuÅºma to make rsyslog compile under
  Solaris again (the patch replaced a strndup() call, which is not
  available under Solaris
- improved debug logging when waiting on select
- updated rsyslogd man page with new options (-46A)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.1 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-29
- added Peter Vrabec's patch for IPv6 TCP
- prefixed all messages send to stderr in rsyslogd with "rsyslogd: "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-28
- Peter Vrabec provided IPv6 for rsyslog, so we are now IPv6 enabled
  IPv6 Support is currently for UDP only, TCP is to come soon.
  AllowedSender configuration does not yet work for IPv6.
- fixed code in iovCreate() that broke C's strict aliasing rules 
- fixed some char/unsigned char differences that forced the compiler
  to spit out warning messages
- updated the Red Hat init script to fix a known issue (thanks to
  Peter Vrabec)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.5 (RGer), 2007-06-22
- made the TCP session limit configurable via command line switch
  now -t <port>,<max sessions>
- added man page for rklogd(8) (basically a copy from klogd, but now
  there is one...)
- fixed a bug that caused internal messages (e.g. rsyslogd startup) to
  appear without a tag.
- removed a minor memory leak that occurred when TAG processing requalified
  a HOSTNAME to be a TAG (and a TAG already was set).
- removed potential small memory leaks in MsgSet***() functions. There
  would be a leak if a property was re-set, something that happened
  extremely seldom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.4 (RGer), 2007-06-18
- added a new property "PRI-text", which holds the PRI field in
  textual form (e.g. "syslog.info")
- added alias "syslogseverity" for "syslogpriority", which is a
  misleading property name that needs to stay for historical
  reasons (and backward-compatility)
- added doc on how to record PRI value in log file
- enhanced signal handling in klogd, including removal of an unsafe
  call to the logging system during signal handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.3 (RGer), 2007-06-15
- create a version of syslog.c from scratch. This is now
  - highly optimized for rsyslog
  - removes an incompatible license problem as the original
    version had a BSD license with advertising clause
  - fixed in the regard that rklogd will continue to work when
    rsysogd has been restarted (the original version, as well
    as sysklogd, will remain silent then)
  - solved an issue with an extra NUL char at message end that the
    original version had
- applied some changes to klogd to care for the new interface
- fixed a bug in syslogd.c which prevented compiling under debian
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.2 (RGer), 2007-06-13
- lib order in makefile patched to facilitate static linking - thanks
  to Bennett Todd for providing the patch
- Integrated a patch from Peter Vrabec (pvrabec@redheat.com):
  - added klogd under the name of rklogd (remove dependency on
    original sysklogd package
  - createDB.sql now in UTF
  - added additional config files for use on Red Hat
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.1 (RGer), 2007-02-05
- changed the listen backlog limit to a more reasonable value based on
  the maximum number of TCP connections configurd (10% + 5) - thanks to Guy
  Standen for the hint (actually, the limit was 5 and that was a 
  left-over from early testing).
- fixed a bug in makefile which caused DB-support to be disabled when
  NETZIP support was enabled
- added the -e option to allow transmission of every message to remote
  hosts (effectively turns off duplicate message suppression)
- (somewhat) improved memory consumption when compiled with MySQL support
- looks like we fixed an incompatibility with MySQL 5.x and above software
  At least in one case, the remote server name was destroyed, leading to 
  a connection failure. The new, improved code does not have this issue and
  so we see this as solved (the new code is generally somewhat better, so
  there is a good chance we fixed this incompatibility).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.0 (RGer), 2006-12-19
- added '$' as ToPos proptery replacer specifier - means "up to the
  end of the string"
- property replacer option "escape-cc", "drop-cc" and "space-cc"  added
- changed the handling of \0 characters inside syslog messages. We now
  consistently escape them to "#000". This is somewhat recommended in
  the draft-ietf-syslog-protocol-19 draft. While the real recomendation
  is to not escape any characters at all, we can not do this without
  considerable modification of the code. So we escape it to "#000", which
  is consistent with a sample found in the Internet-draft.
- removed message glue logic (see printchopped() comment for details)
  Also caused removal of parts table and thus some improvements in
  memory usage.
- changed the default MAXLINE to 2048 to take care of recent syslog
  standardization efforts (can easily be changed in syslogd.c)
- added support for byte-counted TCP syslog messages (much like
  syslog-transport-tls-05 Internet Draft). This was necessary to
  support compression over TCP.
- added support for receiving compressed syslog messages
- added support for sending compressed syslog messages
- fixed a bug where the last message in a syslog/tcp stream was
  lost if it was not properly terminated by a LF character
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.3 (RGer), 2006-10-04
- implemented some changes to support Solaris (but support is not
  yet complete)
- commented out (via #if 0) some methods that are currently not being use
  but should be kept for further us
- added (interim) -u 1 option to turn off hostname and tag parsing
- done some modifications to better support Fedora
- made the field delimiter inside property replace configurable via
  template
- fixed a bug in property replacer: if fields were used, the delimitor
  became part of the field. Up until now, this was barely noticable as 
  the delimiter as TAB only and thus invisible to a human. With other
  delimiters available now, it quickly showed up. This bug fix might cause
  some grief to existing installations if they used the extra TAB for
  whatever reasons - sorry folks... Anyhow, a solution is easy: just add
  a TAB character contstant into your template. Thus, there has no attempt
  been made to do this in a backwards-compatible way.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.2 (RGer), 2006-02-15
- fixed a bug in the RFC 3339 date formatter. An extra space was added
  after the actual timestamp
- added support for providing high-precision RFC3339 timestamps for
  (rsyslogd-)internally-generated messages
- very (!) experimental support for syslog-protocol internet draft
  added (the draft is experimental, the code is solid ;))
- added support for field-extracting in the property replacer
- enhanced the legacy-syslog parser so that it can interpret messages
  that do not contain a TIMESTAMP
- fixed a bug that caused the default socket (usually /dev/log) to be
  opened even when -o command line option was given
- fixed a bug in the Debian sample startup script - it caused rsyslogd
  to listen to remote requests, which it shouldn't by default
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.1 (RGer), 2005-11-23
- made multithreading work with BSD. Some signal-handling needed to be
  restructured. Also, there might be a slight delay of up to 10 seconds
  when huping and terminating rsyslogd under BSD
- fixed a bug where a NULL-pointer was passed to printf() in logmsg().
- fixed a bug during "make install" where rc3195d was not installed
  Thanks to Bennett Todd for spotting this.
- fixed a bug where rsyslogd dumped core when no TAG was found in the
  received message
- enhanced message parser so that it can deal with missing hostnames
  in many cases (may not be totally fail-safe)
- fixed a bug where internally-generated messages did not have the correct
  TAG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.0 (RGer), 2005-10-26
- moved to a multi-threaded design. single-threading is still optionally
  available. Multi-threading is experimental!
- fixed a potential race condition. In the original code, marking was done
  by an alarm handler, which could lead to all sorts of bad things. This
  has been changed now. See comments in syslogd.c/domark() for details.
- improved debug output for property-based filters
- not a code change, but: I have checked all exit()s to make sure that
  none occurs once rsyslogd has started up. Even in unusual conditions
  (like low-memory conditions) rsyslogd somehow remains active. Of course,
  it might loose a message or two, but at least it does not abort and it
  can also recover when the condition no longer persists.
- fixed a bug that could cause loss of the last message received
  immediately before rsyslogd was terminated.
- added comments on thread-safety of global variables in syslogd.c
- fixed a small bug: spurios printf() when TCP syslog was used
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug with regular expression support (thanks to Andres Riancho)
- a little bit of code restructuring (especially main(), which was
  horribly large)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.1 (RGer), 2005-10-19
- support for BSD-style program name and host blocks
- added a new property "programname" that can be used in templates
- added ability to specify listen port for rfc3195d
- fixed a bug that rendered the "startswith" comparison operation
  unusable.
- changed more functions to "static" storage class to help compiler
  optimize (should have been static in the first place...)
- fixed a potential memory leak in the string buffer class destructor.
  As the destructur was previously never called, the leak did not actually
  appear.
- some internal restructuring in anticipation/preparation of minimal
  multi-threading support
- rsyslogd still shares some code with the sysklogd project. Some patches
  for this shared code have been brought over from the sysklogd CVS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.0 (RGer), 2005-10-12
- support for receiving messages via RFC 3195; added rfc3195d for that
  purpose
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.2 (RGer), 2005-09-27
- added comparison operations in property-based filters:
  * isequal
  * startswith
- added ability to negate all property-based filter comparison operations
  by adding a !-sign right in front of the operation name
- added the ability to specify remote senders for UDP and TCP
  received messages. Allows to block all but well-known hosts
- changed the $-config line directives to be case-INsensitive
- new command line option -w added: "do not display warnings if messages
  from disallowed senders are received"
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to dump core when the compare value
  was not quoted in property-based filters
- fixed a bug in the new CStr compare function which lead to invalid
  results (fortunately, this function was not yet used widely)
- added better support for "debugging" rsyslog.conf property filters
  (only if -d switch is given)
- changed some function definitions to static, which eventually enables
  some compiler optimizations
- fixed a bug in MySQL code; when a SQL error occured, rsyslogd could
  run in a tight loop. This was due to invalid sequence of error reporting
  and is now fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- added the ability to execute a shell script as an action.
  Thanks to Bjoern Kalkbrenner for providing the code!
- fixed a bug in the MySQL code; due to the bug the automatic one-time
  retry after an error did not happen - this lead to error message in
  cases where none should be seen (e.g. after a MySQL restart)
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.0 (RGer), 2005-09-20
  REMINDER: 1.10 is the first unstable version if the 1.x series!
- added the capability to filter on any property in selector lines
  (not just facility and priority)
- changed stringbuf into a new counted string class
- added support for a "discard" action. If a selector line with
  discard (~ character) is found, no selector lines *after* that
  line will be processed.
- thanks to Andres Riancho, regular expression support has been
  added to the template engine
- added the FROMHOST property in the template processor, which could
  previously not be obtained. Thanks to Cristian Testa for pointing
  this out and even providing a fix.
- added display of compile-time options to -v output
- performance improvement for production build - made some checks
  to happen only during debug mode
- fixed a problem with compiling on SUSE and - while doing so - removed
  the socket call to set SO_BSDCOMPAT in cases where it is obsolete.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.4 (RGer), 2006-02-01
- a small but important fix: the tcp receiver had two forgotten printf's
  in it that caused a lot of unnecessary output to stdout. This was
  important enough to justify a new release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.3 (RGer), 2005-11-14
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
- applied some patches available from the sysklogd project to code
  shared from there
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug in the TCP sender that caused the retry logic to fail
  after an error or receiver overrun
- fixed a bug in init() that could lead to dumping core
- fixed a bug that could lead to dumping core when no HOSTNAME or no TAG
  was present in the syslog message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.2 (RGer), 2005-10-05
- fixed an issue with MySQL error reporting. When an error occured,
  the MySQL driver went into an endless loop (at least in most cases).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (RGer), 2005-09-12
- changed install doc to cover daily cron scripts - a trouble source
- added rc script for slackware (provided by Chris Elvidge - thanks!) 
- fixed a really minor bug in usage() - the -r option was still
  reported as without the port parameter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.8 (RGer), 2005-09-05
- made startup and shutdown message more consistent and included the
  pid, so that they can be easier correlated. Used syslog-protocol
  structured data format for this purpose.
- improved config info in startup message, now tells not only
  if it is listening remote on udp, but also for tcp. Also includes
  the port numbers. The previous startup message was misleading, because
  it did not say "remote reception" if rsyslogd was only listening via
  tcp (but not via udp).
- added a "how can you help" document to the doc set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.7 (RGer), 2005-08-15
- some of the previous doc files (like INSTALL) did not properly
  reflect the changes to the build process and the new doc. Fixed
  that.
- changed syslogd.c so that when compiled without database support,
  an error message is displayed when a database action is detected
  in the config file (previously this was used as an user rule ;))
- fixed a bug in the os-specific Makefiles which caused MySQL
  support to not be compiled, even if selected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.6 (RGer), 2005-08-09
- greatly enhanced documentation. Now available in html format in
  the "doc" folder and FreeBSD. Finally includes an install howto.
- improved MySQL error messages a little - they now show up as log
  messages, too (formerly only in debug mode)
- added the ability to specify the listen port for udp syslog.
  WARNING: This introduces an incompatibility. Formerly, udp
  syslog was enabled by the -r command line option. Now, it is
  "-r [port]", which is consistent with the tcp listener. However,
  just -r will now return an error message.
- added sample startup scripts for Debian and FreeBSD
- added support for easy feature selection in the makefile. Un-
  fortunately, this also means I needed to spilt the make file
  for different OS and distros. There are some really bad syntax
  differences between FreeBSD and Linux make.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.5 (RGer), 2005-08-01
- the "semicolon bug" was actually not (fully) solved in 0.9.4. One
  part of the bug was solved, but another still existed. This one
  is fixed now, too.
- the "semicolon bug" actually turned out to be a more generic bug.
  It appeared whenever an invalid template name was given. With some
  selector actions, rsyslogd dumped core, with other it "just" had
  a small ressource leak with others all worked well. These anomalies
  are now fixed. Note that they only appeared during system initaliziation
  once the system was running, nothing bad happened.
- improved error reporting for template errors on startup. They are now
  shown on the console and the start-up tty. Formerly, they were only
  visible in debug mode.
- support for multiple instances of rsyslogd on a single machine added
- added new option "-o" --> omit local unix domain socket. This option
  enables rsyslogd NOT to listen to the local socket. This is most
  helpful when multiple instances of rsyslogd (or rsyslogd and another
  syslogd) shall run on a single system.
- added new option "-i <pidfile>" which allows to specify the pidfile.
  This is needed when multiple instances of rsyslogd are to be run.
- the new project home page is now online at www.rsyslog.com
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.4 (RGer), 2005-07-25
- finally added the TCP sender. It now supports non-blocking mode, no
  longer disabling message reception during connect. As it is now, it
  is usable in production. The code could be more sophisticated, but
  I've kept it short in anticipation of the move to liblogging, which
  will lead to the removal of the code just written ;)
- the "exiting on signal..." message still had the "syslogd" name in 
  it. Changed this to "rsyslogd", as we do not have a large user base
  yet, this should pose no problem.
- fixed "the semiconlon" bug. rsyslogd dumped core if a write-db action
  was specified but no semicolon was given after the password (an empty
  template was ok, but the semicolon needed to be present).
- changed a default for traditional output format. During testing, it
  was seen that the timestamp written to file in default format was
  the time of message reception, not the time specified in the TIMESTAMP
  field of the message itself. Traditionally, the message TIMESTAMP is
  used and this has been changed now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.3 (RGer), 2005-07-19
- fixed a bug in the message parser. In June, the RFC 3164 timestamp
  was not correctly parsed (yes, only in June and some other months,
  see the code comment to learn why...)
- added the ability to specify the destination port when forwarding
  syslog messages (both for TCP and UDP)
- added an very experimental TCP sender (activated by
  @@machine:port in config). This is not yet for production use. If
  the receiver is not alive, rsyslogd will wait quite some time until
  the connection request times out, which most probably leads to
  loss of incoming messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.2 (RGer), around 2005-07-06
- I intended to change the maxsupported message size to 32k to
  support IHE - but given the memory inefficiency in the usual use
  cases, I have not done this. I have, however, included very
  specific instructions on how to do this in the source code. I have
  also done some testing with 32k messages, so you can change the
  max size without taking too much risk.
- added a syslog/tcp receiver; we now can receive messages via
  plain tcp, but we can still send only via UDP. The syslog/tcp
  receiver is the primary enhancement of this release.
- slightly changed some error messages that contained a spurios \n at
  the end of the line (which gives empty lines in your log...)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.1 (RGer)
- fixed code so that it compiles without errors under FreeBSD
- removed now unused function "allocate_log()" from syslogd.c
- changed the make file so that it contains more defines for
  different environments (in the long term, we need a better
  system for disabling/enabling features...)
- changed some printf's printing off_t types to %lld and
  explicit (long long) casts. I tried to figure out the exact type,
  but did not succeed in this. In the worst case, ultra-large peta-
  byte files will now display funny informational messages on rollover,
  something I think we can live with for the next 10 years or so...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.0 (RGer)
- changed the filed structure to be a linked list. Previously, it
  was a table - well, for non-SYSV it was defined as linked list,
  but from what I see that code did no longer work after my
  modifications. I am now using a linked list in general because
  that is needed for other upcoming modifications.
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd not to listen to anything if
  the configuration file could not be read
- pervious versions disabled network logging (send/receive) if
  syslog/udp port was not in /etc/services. Now defaulting to
  port 514 in this case.
- internal error messages are now supported up to 256 bytes
- error message seen during config file read are now also displayed
  to the attached tty and not only the console
- changed some error messages during init to be sent to the console
  and/or emergency log. Previously, they were only seen if the
  -d (debug) option was present on the command line.
- fixed the "2gb file issue on 32bit systems". If a file grew to
  more than 2gb, the syslogd was aborted with "file size exceeded". 
  Now, defines have been added according to
  http://www.daimi.au.dk/~kasperd/comp.os.linux.development.faq.html#LARGEFILE
  Testing revealed that they work ;)
  HOWEVER, if your file system, glibc, kernel, whatever does not
  support files larger 2gb, you need to set a file size limit with
  the new output channel mechanism.
- updated man pages to reflect the changes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.4

- improved -d debug output (removed developer-only content)
- now compiles under FreeBSD and NetBSD (only quick testing done on NetBSD)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.3

- security model in "make install" changed
- minor doc updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.2

- added man page for rsyslog.conf and rsyslogd
- gave up on the concept of rsyslog being a "drop in" replacement
  for syslogd. Now, the user installs rsyslogd and also needs to
  adjust his system settings to this specifically. This also lead
  to these changes:
  * changed Makefile so that install now installs rsyslogd instead
    of dealing with syslogd
  * changed the default config file name to rsyslog.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.1

- fixed a nasty memory leak (probably not the last one with this release)
- some enhancements to Makefile as suggested by Bennett Todd
- syslogd-internal messages (like restart) were missing the hostname
  this has been corrected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.0

Initial testing release. Based on the sysklogd package. Thanks to the
sysklogd maintainers for all their good work!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following comments are from the stock syslogd.c source. They provide
some insight into what happened to the source before we forked
rsyslogd. However, much of the code already has been replaced and more
is to be replaced. So over time, these comments become less valuable.
I have moved them out of the syslogd.c file to shrink it, especially
as a lot of them do no longer apply. For historical reasons and
understanding of how the daemon evolved, they are probably still
helpful.
 * Author: Eric Allman
 * extensive changes by Ralph Campbell
 * more extensive changes by Eric Allman (again)
 *
 * Steve Lord:	Fix UNIX domain socket code, added linux kernel logging
 *		change defines to
 *		SYSLOG_INET	- listen on a UDP socket
 *		SYSLOG_UNIXAF	- listen on unix domain socket
 *		SYSLOG_KERNEL	- listen to linux kernel
 *
 * Mon Feb 22 09:55:42 CST 1993:  Dr. Wettstein
 * 	Additional modifications to the source.  Changed priority scheme
 *	to increase the level of configurability.  In its stock configuration
 *	syslogd no longer logs all messages of a certain priority and above
 *	to a log file.  The * wildcard is supported to specify all priorities.
 *	Note that this is a departure from the BSD standard.
 *
 *	Syslogd will now listen to both the inetd and the unixd socket.  The
 *	strategy is to allow all local programs to direct their output to
 *	syslogd through the unixd socket while the program listens to the
 *	inetd socket to get messages forwarded from other hosts.
 *
 * Fri Mar 12 16:55:33 CST 1993:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Thanks to Stephen Tweedie (dcs.ed.ac.uk!sct) for helpful bug-fixes
 *	and an enlightened commentary on the prioritization problem.
 *
 *	Changed the priority scheme so that the default behavior mimics the
 *	standard BSD.  In this scenario all messages of a specified priority
 *	and above are logged.
 *
 *	Add the ability to specify a wildcard (=) as the first character
 *	of the priority name.  Doing this specifies that ONLY messages with
 *	this level of priority are to be logged.  For example:
 *
 *		*.=debug			/usr/adm/debug
 *
 *	Would log only messages with a priority of debug to the /usr/adm/debug
 *	file.
 *
 *	Providing an * as the priority specifies that all messages are to be
 *	logged.  Note that this case is degenerate with specifying a priority
 *	level of debug.  The wildcard * was retained because I believe that
 *	this is more intuitive.
 *
 * Thu Jun 24 11:34:13 CDT 1993:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Modified sources to incorporate changes in libc4.4.  Messages from
 *	syslog are now null-terminated, syslogd code now parses messages
 *	based on this termination scheme.  Linux as of libc4.4 supports the
 *	fsync system call.  Modified code to fsync after all writes to
 *	log files.
 *
 * Sat Dec 11 11:59:43 CST 1993:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Extensive changes to the source code to allow compilation with no
 *	complaints with -Wall.
 *
 *	Reorganized the facility and priority name arrays so that they
 *	compatible with the syslog.h source found in /usr/include/syslog.h.
 *	NOTE that this should really be changed.  The reason I do not
 *	allow the use of the values defined in syslog.h is on account of
 *	the extensions made to allow the wildcard character in the
 *	priority field.  To fix this properly one should malloc an array,
 *	copy the contents of the array defined by syslog.h and then
 *	make whatever modifications that are desired.  Next round.
 *
 * Thu Jan  6 12:07:36 CST 1994:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Added support for proper decomposition and re-assembly of
 *	fragment messages on UNIX domain sockets.  Lack of this capability
 *	was causing 'partial' messages to be output.  Since facility and
 *	priority information is encoded as a leader on the messages this
 *	was causing lines to be placed in erroneous files.
 *
 *	Also added a patch from Shane Alderton (shane@ion.apana.org.au) to
 *	correct a problem with syslogd dumping core when an attempt was made
 *	to write log messages to a logged-on user.  Thank you.
 *
 *	Many thanks to Juha Virtanen (jiivee@hut.fi) for a series of
 *	interchanges which lead to the fixing of problems with messages set
 *	to priorities of none and emerg.  Also thanks to Juha for a patch
 *	to exclude users with a class of LOGIN from receiving messages.
 *
 *	Shane Alderton provided an additional patch to fix zombies which
 *	were conceived when messages were written to multiple users.
 *
 * Mon Feb  6 09:57:10 CST 1995:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Patch to properly reset the single priority message flag.  Thanks
 *	to Christopher Gori for spotting this bug and forwarding a patch.
 *
 * Wed Feb 22 15:38:31 CST 1995:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Added version information to startup messages.
 *
 *	Added defines so that paths to important files are taken from
 *	the definitions in paths.h.  Hopefully this will insure that
 *	everything follows the FSSTND standards.  Thanks to Chris Metcalf
 *	for a set of patches to provide this functionality.  Also thanks
 *	Elias Levy for prompting me to get these into the sources.
 *
 * Wed Jul 26 18:57:23 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Linux' gethostname only returns the hostname and not the fqdn as
 *	expected in the code. But if you call hostname with an fqdn then
 *	gethostname will return an fqdn, so we have to mention that. This
 *	has been changed.
 *
 *	The 'LocalDomain' and the hostname of a remote machine is
 *	converted to lower case, because the original caused some
 *	inconsistency, because the (at least my) nameserver did respond an
 *	fqdn containing of upper- _and_ lowercase letters while
 *	'LocalDomain' consisted only of lowercase letters and that didn't
 *	match.
 *
 * Sat Aug  5 18:59:15 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Now no messages that were received from any remote host are sent
 *	out to another. At my domain this missing feature caused ugly
 *	syslog-loops, sometimes.
 *
 *	Remember that no message is sent out. I can't figure out any
 *	scenario where it might be useful to change this behavior and to
 *	send out messages to other hosts than the one from which we
 *	received the message, but I might be shortsighted. :-/
 *
 * Thu Aug 10 19:01:08 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Added my pidfile.[ch] to it to perform a better handling with
 *	pidfiles. Now both, syslogd and klogd, can only be started
 *	once. They check the pidfile.
 *
 * Sun Aug 13 19:01:41 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Add an addition to syslog.conf's interpretation. If a priority
 *	begins with an exclamation mark ('!') the normal interpretation
 *	of the priority is inverted: ".!*" is the same as ".none", ".!=info"
 *	don't logs the info priority, ".!crit" won't log any message with
 *	the priority crit or higher. For example:
 *
 *		mail.*;mail.!=info		/usr/adm/mail
 *
 *	Would log all messages of the facility mail except those with
 *	the priority info to /usr/adm/mail. This makes the syslogd
 *	much more flexible.
 *
 *	Defined TABLE_ALLPRI=255 and changed some occurrences.
 *
 * Sat Aug 19 21:40:13 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Making the table of facilities and priorities while in debug
 *	mode more readable.
 *
 *	If debugging is turned on, printing the whole table of
 *	facilities and priorities every hexadecimal or 'X' entry is
 *	now 2 characters wide.
 *
 *	The number of the entry is prepended to each line of
 *	facilities and priorities, and F_UNUSED lines are not shown
 *	anymore.
 *
 *	Corrected some #ifdef SYSV's.
 *
 * Mon Aug 21 22:10:35 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Corrected a strange behavior during parsing of configuration
 *	file. The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as
 *	separators between specifier and action. This syslogd now
 *	understands them. The old behavior caused some confusion over
 *	the Linux community.
 *
 * Thu Oct 19 00:02:07 MET 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	The default behavior has changed for security reasons. The
 *	syslogd will not receive any remote message unless you turn
 *	reception on with the "-r" option.
 *
 *	Not defining SYSLOG_INET will result in not doing any network
 *	activity, i.e. not sending or receiving messages.  I changed
 *	this because the old idea is implemented with the "-r" option
 *	and the old thing didn't work anyway.
 *
 * Thu Oct 26 13:14:06 MET 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Added another logfile type F_FORW_UNKN.  The problem I ran into
 *	was a name server that runs on my machine and a forwarder of
 *	kern.crit to another host.  The hosts address can only be
 *	fetched using the nameserver.  But named is started after
 *	syslogd, so syslogd complained.
 *
 *	This logfile type will retry to get the address of the
 *	hostname ten times and then complain.  This should be enough to
 *	get the named up and running during boot sequence.
 *
 * Fri Oct 27 14:08:15 1995:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Changed static array of logfiles to a dynamic array. This
 *	can grow during process.
 *
 * Fri Nov 10 23:08:18 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Inserted a new tabular sys_h_errlist that contains plain text
 *	for error codes that are returned from the net subsystem and
 *	stored in h_errno. I have also changed some wrong lookups to
 *	sys_errlist.
 *
 * Wed Nov 22 22:32:55 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Added the fabulous strip-domain feature that allows us to
 *	strip off (several) domain names from the fqdn and only log
 *	the simple hostname. This is useful if you're in a LAN that
 *	has a central log server and also different domains.
 *
 *	I have also also added the -l switch do define hosts as
 *	local. These will get logged with their simple hostname, too.
 *
 * Thu Nov 23 19:02:56 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
 *	Added the possibility to omit fsyncing of logfiles after every
 *	write. This will give some performance back if you have
 *	programs that log in a very verbose manner (like innd or
 *	smartlist). Thanks to Stephen R. van den Berg <srb@cuci.nl>
 *	for the idea.
 *
 * Thu Jan 18 11:14:36 CST 1996:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Added patche from beta-testers to stop compile error.  Also
 *	added removal of pid file as part of termination cleanup.
 *
 * Wed Feb 14 12:42:09 CST 1996:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Allowed forwarding of messages received from remote hosts to
 *	be controlled by a command-line switch.  Specifying -h allows
 *	forwarding.  The default behavior is to disable forwarding of
 *	messages which were received from a remote host.
 *
 *	Parent process of syslogd does not exit until child process has
 *	finished initialization process.  This allows rc.* startup to
 *	pause until syslogd facility is up and operating.
 *
 *	Re-arranged the select code to move UNIX domain socket accepts
 *	to be processed later.  This was a contributed change which
 *	has been proposed to correct the delays sometimes encountered
 *	when syslogd starts up.
 *
 *	Minor code cleanups.
 *
 * Thu May  2 15:15:33 CDT 1996:  Dr. Wettstein
 *	Fixed bug in init function which resulted in file descripters
 *	being orphaned when syslogd process was re-initialized with SIGHUP
 *	signal.  Thanks to Edvard Tuinder
 *	(Edvard.Tuinder@praseodymium.cistron.nl) for putting me on the
 *	trail of this bug.  I am amazed that we didn't catch this one
 *	before now.
 *
 * Tue May 14 00:03:35 MET DST 1996:  Martin Schulze
 *	Corrected a mistake that causes the syslogd to stop logging at
 *	some virtual consoles under Linux. This was caused by checking
 *	the wrong error code. Thanks to Michael Nonweiler
 *	<mrn20@hermes.cam.ac.uk> for sending me a patch.
 *
 * Mon May 20 13:29:32 MET DST 1996:  Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
 *	Added continuation line supported and fixed a bug in
 *	the init() code.
 *
 * Tue May 28 00:58:45 MET DST 1996:  Martin Schulze
 *	Corrected behaviour of blocking pipes - i.e. the whole system
 *	hung.  Michael Nonweiler <mrn20@hermes.cam.ac.uk> has sent us
 *	a patch to correct this.  A new logfile type F_PIPE has been
 *	introduced.
 *
 * Mon Feb 3 10:12:15 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
 *	Corrected behaviour of logfiles if the file can't be opened.
 *	There was a bug that causes syslogd to try to log into non
 *	existing files which ate cpu power.
 *
 * Sun Feb 9 03:22:12 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
 *	Modified syslogd.c to not kill itself which confuses bash 2.0.
 *
 * Mon Feb 10 00:09:11 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
 *	Improved debug code to decode the numeric facility/priority
 *	pair into textual information.
 *
 * Tue Jun 10 12:35:10 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
 *	Corrected freeing of logfiles.  Thanks to Jos Vos <jos@xos.nl>
 *	for reporting the bug and sending an idea to fix the problem.
 *
 * Tue Jun 10 12:51:41 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
 *	Removed sleep(10) from parent process.  This has caused a slow
 *	startup in former times - and I don't see any reason for this.
 *
 * Sun Jun 15 16:23:29 MET DST 1997: Michael Alan Dorman
 *	Some more glibc patches made by <mdorman@debian.org>.
 *
 * Thu Jan  1 16:04:52 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de
 *	Applied patch from Herbert Thielen <Herbert.Thielen@lpr.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de>.
 *	This included some balance parentheses for emacs and a bug in
 *	the exclamation mark handling.
 *
 *	Fixed small bug which caused syslogd to write messages to the
 *	wrong logfile under some very rare conditions.  Thanks to
 *	Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au> for fiddling this out.
 *
 * Thu Jan  8 22:46:35 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Reworked one line of the above patch as it prevented syslogd
 *	from binding the socket with the result that no messages were
 *	forwarded to other hosts.
 *
 * Sat Jan 10 01:33:06 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Fixed small bugs in F_FORW_UNKN meachanism.  Thanks to Torsten
 *	Neumann <torsten@londo.rhein-main.de> for pointing me to it.
 *
 * Mon Jan 12 19:50:58 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Modified debug output concerning remote receiption.
 *
 * Mon Feb 23 23:32:35 CET 1998: Topi Miettinen <Topi.Miettinen@ml.tele.fi>
 *	Re-worked handling of Unix and UDP sockets to support closing /
 *	opening of them in order to have it open only if it is needed
 *	either for forwarding to a remote host or by receiption from
 *	the network.
 *
 * Wed Feb 25 10:54:09 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Fixed little comparison mistake that prevented the MARK
 *	feature to work properly.
 *
 * Wed Feb 25 13:21:44 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Corrected Topi's patch as it prevented forwarding during
 *	startup due to an unknown LogPort.
 *
 * Sat Oct 10 20:01:48 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Added support for TESTING define which will turn syslogd into
 *	stdio-mode used for debugging.
 *
 * Sun Oct 11 20:16:59 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Reworked the initialization/fork code.  Now the parent
 *	process activates a signal handler which the daughter process
 *	will raise if it is initialized.  Only after that one the
 *	parent process may exit.  Otherwise klogd might try to flush
 *	its log cache while syslogd can't receive the messages yet.
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 13:30:35 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Redirected some error output with regard to argument parsing to
 *	stderr.
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 14:02:51 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Applied patch provided vom Topi Miettinen with regard to the
 *	people from OpenBSD.  This provides the additional '-a'
 *	argument used for specifying additional UNIX domain sockets to
 *	listen to.  This is been used with chroot()'ed named's for
 *	example.  See for http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 18:29:44 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Added `ftp' facility which was introduced in glibc version 2.
 *	It's #ifdef'ed so won't harm with older libraries.
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 19:59:21 MET DST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Code cleanups with regard to bsd -> posix transition and
 *	stronger security (buffer length checking).  Thanks to Topi
 *	Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>
 *	. index() --> strchr()
 *	. sprintf() --> snprintf()
 *	. bcopy() --> memcpy()
 *	. bzero() --> memset()
 *	. UNAMESZ --> UT_NAMESIZE
 *	. sys_errlist --> strerror()
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 20:22:59 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Added support for setutent()/getutent()/endutend() instead of
 *	binary reading the UTMP file.  This is the the most portable
 *	way.  This allows /var/run/utmp format to change, even to a
 *	real database or utmp daemon. Also if utmp file locking is
 *	implemented in libc, syslog will use it immediately.  Thanks
 *	to Topi Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>.
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 20:49:18 MET DST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Avoid logging of SIGCHLD when syslogd is in the process of
 *	exiting and closing its files.  Again thanks to Topi.
 *
 * Mon Oct 12 22:18:34 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Modified printline() to support 8bit characters - such as
 *	russion letters.  Thanks to Vladas Lapinskas <lapinskas@mail.iae.lt>.
 *
 * Sat Nov 14 02:29:37 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	``-m 0'' now turns of MARK logging entirely.
 *
 * Tue Jan 19 01:04:18 MET 1999: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Finally fixed an error with `-a' processing, thanks to Topi
 *	Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>.
 *
 * Sun May 23 10:08:53 CEST 1999: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
 *	Removed superflous call to utmpname().  The path to the utmp
 *	file is defined in the used libc and should not be hardcoded
 *	into the syslogd binary referring the system it was compiled on.
 *
 * Sun Sep 17 20:45:33 CEST 2000: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.ffis.de>
 *	Fixed some bugs in printline() code that did not escape
 *	control characters '\177' through '\237' and contained a
 *	single-byte buffer overflow.  Thanks to Solar Designer
 *	<solar@false.com>.
 *
 * Sun Sep 17 21:26:16 CEST 2000: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.ffis.de>
 *	Don't close open sockets upon reload.  Thanks to Bill
 *	Nottingham.
 *
 * Mon Sep 18 09:10:47 CEST 2000: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.ffis.de>
 *	Fixed bug in printchopped() that caused syslogd to emit
 *	kern.emerg messages when splitting long lines.  Thanks to
 *	Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@debian.org> for the fix.
 *
 * Mon Sep 18 15:33:26 CEST 2000: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.ffis.de>
 *	Removed unixm/unix domain sockets and switch to Datagram Unix
 *	Sockets.  This should remove one possibility to play DoS with
 *	syslogd.  Thanks to Olaf Kirch <okir@caldera.de> for the patch.
 *
 * Sun Mar 11 20:23:44 CET 2001: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.ffis.de>
 *	Don't return a closed fd if `-a' is called with a wrong path.
 *	Thanks to Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com> for providing
 *	a patch.
