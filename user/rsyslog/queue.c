	 * support. Enhanced flow control is being added today. There are some sources which
	 * can easily be stopped, e.g. a file reader. This is the case because it is unlikely
	 * that blocking those sources will have negative effects (after all, the file is
	 * continued to be written). Other sources can somewhat be blocked (e.g. the kernel
	 * log reader or the local log stream reader): in general, nothing is lost if messages
	 * from these sources are not picked up immediately. HOWEVER, they can not block for
	 * an extended period of time, as this either causes message loss or - even worse - some
	 * other bad effects (e.g. unresponsive system in respect to the main system log socket).
	 * Finally, there are some (few) sources which can not be blocked at all. UDP syslog is
	 * a prime example. If a UDP message is not received, it is simply lost. So we can't
	 * do anything against UDP sockets that come in too fast. The core idea of advanced
	 * flow control is that we take into account the different natures of the sources and
	 * select flow control mechanisms that fit these needs. This also means, in the end
	 * result, that non-blockable sources like UDP syslog receive priority in the system.
	 * It's a side effect, but a good one ;) -- rgerhards, 2008-03-14
