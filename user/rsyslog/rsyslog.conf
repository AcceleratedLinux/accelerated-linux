# rsyslog v3: load input modules
# If you do not load inputs, nothing happens!
# You may need to set the module load path if modules are not found.

# ######### Receiving Messages from Remote Hosts ########## 
# TCP Syslog Server:
# provides TCP syslog reception and GSS-API (if compiled to support it)
#$ModLoad imtcp.so  # load module
# Note: as of now, you need to use the -t command line option to
# enable TCP reception (e.g. -t514 to run a server at port 514/tcp)
# This will change in later v3 releases.

# UDP Syslog Server:
#$ModLoad imudp.so  # provides UDP syslog reception
#$UDPServerRun 514 # start a UDP syslog server at standard port 514
