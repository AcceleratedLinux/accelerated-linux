/* generic worker thread framework
 *
 * Some special comments below, so that they do not clutter the main function code:
 *
 * On the use of pthread_testcancel():
 * Now make sure we can get canceled - it is not specified if pthread_setcancelstate() is
 * a cancellation point in itself. As we run most of the time without cancel enabled, I fear
 * we may never get cancelled if we do not create a cancellation point ourselfs.
 *
 * On the use of pthread_yield():
 * We yield to give the other threads a chance to obtain the mutex. If we do not
 * do that, this thread may very well aquire the mutex again before another thread
 * has even a chance to run. The reason is that mutex operations are free to be
 * implemented in the quickest possible way (and they typically are!). That is, the
 * mutex lock/unlock most probably just does an atomic memory swap and does not necessarily
 * schedule other threads waiting on the same mutex. That can lead to the same thread
 * aquiring the mutex ever and ever again while all others are starving for it. We
 * have exactly seen this behaviour when we deliberately introduced a long-running
 * test action which basically did a sleep. I understand that with real actions the
 * likelihood of this starvation condition is very low - but it could still happen
 * and would be very hard to debug. The yield() is a sure fix, its performance overhead
 * should be well accepted given the above facts. -- rgerhards, 2008-01-10
