POSIX ACLs (File ACLs)
----------------------

As of 1.3.0rc1, ProFTPD has support for POSIX ACLs.  This is a new feature
and should be considered experimental.

For more information on what POSIX ACLs are and how they work, see
"POSIX ACLs on Linux":

    http://www.suse.de/~agruen/acl/linux-acls/online/

POSIX ACLs are supported and implemented differently on Linux, BSD, and
Solaris.  ProFTPD attempts to work properly with POSIX ACLs on all of
these platforms.

The configure script automatically checks to see if your system has
support for POSIX ACLs.  However, proftpd will not make use of any
POSIX ACL support unless specifically requested:

  ./configure --enable-facl ...

This configure option tells proftpd to compile and link against the proper
libraries.  However, to make proftpd fully honor any POSIX ACLs on files,
you will also need the mod_facl module:

  ./configure --enable-facl --with-modules=mod_facl ...

Note that on some systems (notably Red Hat installations), you may encounter
the following error when compiling proftpd with ACL support:

  libtool: link: cannot find the library `/lib/libattr.la'

This is caused by a bug in the /usr/lib/libacl.la file.  This is a text
file which mentions /lib/libattr.la, when it should use /usr/lib/libattr.la.
You may have to manually edit the /usr/lib/libacl.la file to correct
the problem.

Future work on ProFTPD's support of POSIX ACLs will most likely include
changing mod_ls so that it displays a '+' symbol when LISTing files,
denoting a file marked with  POSIX ACLs, and perhaps adding support for
SITE commands for manipulating ACLs (similar to SITE CHMOD).
