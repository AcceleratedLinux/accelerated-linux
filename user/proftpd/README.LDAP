John Morrissey, <jwm@horde.net>, http://horde.net/~jwm/software/mod_ldap/.
Feedback is much appreciated. If you're using mod_ldap successfully, are
having problems getting mod_ldap up and running at your site, or have some
code improvements or ideas for development, please let me know!

============================
2. How do I set up mod_ldap?
============================

If you are using a version of mod_ldap included with a ProFTPD release,
you can simply:

* tar xvzf proftpd-version.tar.gz
* If you wish to use a newer version of mod_ldap that is not yet included
  with a release version of ProFTPD, download the file mod_ldap.c and say:

    cp -f mod_ldap.c proftpd-version/contrib

* cd proftpd-version
* ./configure --with-modules=mod_ldap
* make
* make install
* If your LDAP server runs OpenLDAP 1.x, you need to add schema definitions. 
  Add the contents of posixAccount-objectclass to your slapd.oc.conf and
  restart your LDAP server. If you plan on using mod_ldap for group lookups,
  also add the contents of posixGroup-objectclass. OpenLDAP 2.x (and most
  other LDAP servers) ship with these schema predefined.
* The 'user-ldif' file contains a sample user ldif. Modify it to your liking
  and say ldapadd -D your-root-dn -w your-root-dn-password < ldif
* You are *strongly* encouraged to read up on the LDAP config-file
  directives in proftpd-version/doc/Configuration.html. At bare minimum,
  you'll need to have LDAPServer, LDAPDNInfo, and LDAPDoAuth configuration
  directives in your proftpd.conf.

  A set of basic mod_ldap configuration directives would look like:

    LDAPServer            localhost
    LDAPDNInfo            cn=your-dn,dc=example,dc=com dnpass
    LDAPDoAuth            on "dc=users,dc=example,dc=com"

  Of course, you will need to update these configuration directives with
  the proper values for your environment.

4. To Do
========

* Multiple-group support. I've received patches; this should be released
  soon.
* Debugging information needs to be significantly improved. Currently, error
  messages (with the complete LDAP error message) are logged for any
  failures, but it would be nice to have extended debugging information.
* shadowAccount objectclass stuff - inactive, expiration, etc - Is there
  any demand for this? It's been months since I've heard anyone express
  interest.
