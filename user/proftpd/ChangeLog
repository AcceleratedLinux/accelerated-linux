	* doc/contrib/mod_load.html: 
	Eliminated the need for Solaris users to do anything special when
	building mod_load; its configure script handles everything.

2005-01-01 11:39  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/: configure.in, getloadavg.c, mod_load.c,
	mod_load.c.in: 
	Modified the configure script to detect when additional libraries
	are needed, and to generate mod_load.c from mod_load.c.in, with the
	$Libraries$ tag properly populated.
	
	Note that newer autoconf treatment of the AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG macro
	requires that a getloadavg.c file be present, even if empty.  How
	annoying.

2005-01-01 11:13  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/mod_load.c: 
	No need for mod_load's getloadavg() function to be visible outside
	of the source file.

2005-01-01 11:02  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/mod_load.c: 
	Fix some compiler warnings about formats.
	
	Add an empty $Libraries$ tag.  Soon, mod_load's configure script
	will process the mod_load source, and substitute in a list of
	libraries that mod_load conditionally requires (e.g. libkstat on
	Solaris).

2005-01-01 10:55  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_load/mod_load.c:

	up on the updated source file and does The Right Thing.

2004-12-17 13:56  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Avoid compiler warning about unused function.

2004-12-17 10:24  castaglia

	Bug#2536 - mod_ifsession does not properly merge in all directives.

2004-12-16 17:58  castaglia

	* src/sets.c: 
	Update xaset_insert_end() so that it updates the 'next' field of
	the previous member in the set.

2004-12-16 17:25  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	Hide some of the label strings used by mod_ifsession by prefacing
	their names with an underscore.  Such names are not displayed by
	pr_config_dump().

2004-12-16 16:03  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c: 
	Typo.

2004-12-16 15:54  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	Support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 15:37  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.c: 
	Support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 15:26  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Add code to support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 14:55  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_quotatab.c, mod_quotatab.h, mod_quotatab_file.c,
	mod_quotatab_ldap.c, mod_quotatab_sql.c: 
	Add a new quotatab_unregister_backend() function to the
	mod_quotatab API, and rename quotatab_register() to
	quotatab_register_backend().  This makes it consistent with
	mod_sql's backend API, and also makes it possible to unregister a
	quotatab backend module.
	
	Adds support for graceful unloading of mod_quotatab et al as shared
	modules.

2004-12-16 11:38  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Add code to mod_tls to support being unloaded as a shared module.

2004-12-16 10:33  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c, src/main.c: 
	Rather than having the core engine unload modules during a restart,
	have them unloaded by mod_dso.	That's only fair, since a) mod_dso
	was responsible for loading the modules in the first place, and b)
	mod_dso also handles the unloaded of the handles from libltdl,
	about which the core engine knows nothing.

2004-12-16 10:17  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Tweak the SQL modules to better handle being built as shared
	modules.

2004-12-16 10:13  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	During a restart (e.g. SIGHUP), unload all non-static modules, i.e.
	all shared modules that have been dynamically loaded.  This is to
	handle the case where an admin removes a LoadModule directive from
	proftpd.conf, then issues a SIGHUP.
	
	Note that this requires changes to shared modules, to make sure
	they unload themselves properly.  Such changes for the contrib/
	modules will follow shortly.

2004-12-15 19:01  castaglia

	* include/event.h, src/event.c: 
	Tweak the Event API to allow blanket unregistration of all a
	module's event listeners in one pr_event_unregister() call.
	
	Gracefully avoid a possible segfault during pr_event_register().

2004-12-15 18:30  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: 
	'login' is a global variable somewhere, so compiling under
	--enable-devel kicks up compiler warnings.

2004-12-15 18:23  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	The shell's test function prefers to operate on single strings, so
	enclose the expanded $SHARED_MODULE_OBJS list within quotations.

2004-12-15 16:54  castaglia

	* doc/howto/DisplayFiles.html: 
	Updating the DisplayFiles doc with the newly added Display
	variables.

2004-12-15 16:50  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: DisplayFiles.html, index.html: 
	Adding a doc covering the Display directives.

2004-12-12 15:55  castaglia

	* doc/howto/DSO.html: 
	Grammatical nicety.

2004-12-12 15:03  castaglia

	Updating URL for current location under doc/howto/.

2004-12-12 15:01  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: ListOptions.html, index.html: 
	Adding the ListOptions howto to the source distribution.

2004-12-12 14:57  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Update the release notes.

2004-12-12 14:56  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2534 - Add suport for -S ListOption, for sorting files by file
	size.

2004-12-12 14:00  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2229 - NLST and LIST behave differently e.g. when listing an
	empty directory.  Make the behavior between LIST and LIST
	consistent with respect to empty directories, and when listing
	nonexistent directories.

2004-12-12 13:52  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: DSO.html, index.html: 
	Adding DSO howto to source distribution.

2004-12-12 11:27  castaglia

	Add documentation for the SQLEngine directive.

2004-12-12 09:53  castaglia

	* NEWS, RELEASE_NOTES, contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Bug#2406 - Add a SQLEngine directive.

2004-12-11 21:59  castaglia

	* modules/: mod_ctrls.c, mod_site.c: 
	Use the Auth API functions in the 'pr_' namespace.

2004-12-11 16:14  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Bug#2027 - Add log message for timed out passive transfers.

2004-12-08 14:30  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Explicitly mention that only one type of limit is in effect at a
	time, and that applicable limits for a given user are not combined.

2004-12-05 00:12  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Yet another place where main_server needs to be set to NULL before
	calling free_pools().  Only affects servers built using the
	--enable-devel=nodaemon option.

2004-12-05 00:03  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	If main_server is not set to NULL before freeing all of the pools
	(from which main_server is allocated), segfaults can occur if
	something tries to log a message.  Note that this only happens if
	the --enable-devel configure option is used, so it doesn't affect
	most users.

2004-12-04 23:58  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Properly set session.c and session.d to NULL once we've closed
	them.

2004-12-04 22:38  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Authentication.html: 
	Correct the RequireValidShell FAQ URL.

2004-12-04 21:50  castaglia

	* include/auth.h, modules/mod_auth.c, src/auth.c: 
	Move that code responsible for looking up the anonymous
	configuration for a given user name, if applicable, out of
	mod_auth.c and into the Auth API.  The main reason for this is to
	allow contrib modules that may need to determine whether a given
	login is to be handled anonymously (e.g.  mod_wrap, mod_sql) the
	ability to use the same code as mod_auth, rather than having to
	duplicate it themselves.  A nice side benefit as that the Auth API
	function added, pr_auth_get_anon_config(), more legibly describes
	what the function does.  This will help to make the mod_auth code
	slightly easier to understand (for some value of "easier").

2004-12-04 20:25  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Limit.html: 
	Add examples of blocking PORT or PASV commands.

2004-12-04 11:17  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: Upgrade.html, index.html: 
	Add an Upgrade mini-HOWTO to doc/howto/.

2004-12-04 01:20  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Fix up the links to the quotatab submodule docs.

2004-12-04 01:13  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Update the mod_quotatab installation instructions.

2004-12-03 23:52  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_quotatab.c, contrib/mod_quotatab.h,
	doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html: 
	Add some Display variables for mod_quotatab:
	
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.bytes_in}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.bytes_out}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.bytes_xfer}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.files_in}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.files_out}
	  %{mod_quotatab.limit.files_xfer}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.bytes_in}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.bytes_out}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.bytes_xfer}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.files_in}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.files_out}
	  %{mod_quotatab.tally.files_xfer}
	
	These are documented in the mod_quotatab documentation under
	doc/contrib/.

2004-12-03 23:43  castaglia

	* src/var.c: 
	Pass the exact pointers provided by callers of pr_var_set(), rather
	than copies of the pointed-to data.

	Display variables.

	Bug#2528 - Incorrect username 'and' parsing in AllowUser.

	Close the control and data connections before running any
	registered 'core.exit' event handlers.

2004-12-01 17:24  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Unregister the NetIO streams registered by mod_tls during its
	'core.exit' handler.  This prevents segfaults that can happen when
	a session is exiting (as when ABORting an in-progress data
	transfer).

2004-12-01 10:08  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.c, modules/mod_core.c, modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Correct a few lingering cases where pr_log_pri() was being called
	with a log level that wasn't in the PR_ namespace.

2004-11-29 14:28  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: include signal.h to fix the build under
	Solaris 8

2004-11-24 12:38  castaglia

	* src/support.c: 
	More old-style exit handler cruft.

2004-11-22 19:43  castaglia

	* src/display.c: 
	Extraneous #include (and at the bottom of a file).

2004-11-22 19:30  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	We were calling pr_display_file() on DisplayQuit files with the
	arguments in the wrong order.

2004-11-21 22:09  castaglia

	* doc/contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Fix the mod_ctrls_admin documentation.	First, there was a
	duplicate entry for the 'down' control action.	Second, the
	'shutdown' entry had gone completely missing.

2004-11-21 21:36  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Bug#2510 - Use of ExportCertData TLSOption leads to segfault.

2004-11-21 21:21  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Since we stuff an SSL * in the strm_data slot for each NetIO
	stream, and there are two streams for a connection, when closing a
	connection, we want to call tls_end_session() (which ends up
	freeing that SSL *) only once per connection.  I chose to do this
	always for the write stream of a connection.  Should help with some
	of the OpenSSL reference counter issues we've been seeing.
	
	This patch is also part of the solution for Bug #2313.

2004-11-21 17:37  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Adding some missing logic; pointers that have been free()'d should
	always be set to NULL afterwards.

2004-11-21 16:34  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	As per Michael's suggestion, remove the .libs/ directory, and
	libtool, during the 'distclean' target.

	* src/support.c:

	Straggler run_exit_handlers() call.  Be gone with ye!

2004-11-21 16:21  castaglia

	* include/support.h, src/main.c, src/support.c: 
	No more support for the old-style exit handlers.

2004-11-21 15:36  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Allow SIGTERM to interrupt mod_delay.

2004-11-21 12:26  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Since mod_delay uses mmap(), any updates it makes to the DelayTable
	won't be reflected in the mtime field of the file's metadata.  To
	help alleviate this perception, add a 'core.exit' event handler
	that explicitly writes out the DelayTable to disk.
	
	Fix up some memory problems spotted under valgrind.  Also, if the
	expected DelayTable is smaller than the current table, make sure we
	truncate the file.

2004-11-21 11:16  castaglia

	been.

2004-11-20 14:35  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/timers.h, src/main.c, src/timers.c: 
	Bug#2516 - Getting "421 Login Timeout" immediately upon connect. 
	The child processes were inheriting the values of static Timer API
	variables, including the parent's timer list.  This causes problems
	when, in the parent process, one of those static variables stops
	being properly updated.  I'm not convinced that the root cause of
	this bug has been found, but this patch addresses the problematic
	behavior, so that at least session processes aren't affected so
	badly.

2004-11-20 13:20  castaglia

	* src/timers.c: 
	Be a little more paranoid: don't set the indispatch flag until
	after alarms have been blocked.

2004-11-20 12:38  castaglia

	* README.IPv6: 
	Remove mention of the Bind directive.  We want it gone.

	Updating configure.

2004-11-17 09:28  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Tweak the configure script to always use our bundled version of
	getaddrinfo() on HP-UX 11.x, since HP-UX's getaddrinfo() (among
	many other things) is busted.

2004-11-14 17:39  castaglia

	* README.modules: 
	Updating README.modules.

2004-11-14 16:21  castaglia

	Deny the SIZE command if we're in ASCII mode, as we do for REST. 
	Be sure to add debug logging for both of these cases.

2004-11-14 15:58  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Check that a scoreboard entry's PID is non-zero before sending the
	zero signal to that PID.

2004-11-14 15:45  castaglia

	* NEWS, doc/howto/ASCII.html, doc/howto/index.html,

	files.

2004-11-14 13:03  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: Scoreboard.html, index.html: 
	Adding a ScoreboardFile mini-HOWTO.

2004-11-13 15:01  castaglia

	* ltmain.sh: 
	Increase the max allowed command line length in the libtool script
	to be 4K.  I'd rather we encounter the system limit before an
	arbitrarily imposed one.

2004-11-13 14:47  castaglia

	* include/fsio.h, src/fsio.c: 
	Beginnings of support for stackable FSIO layers.  Rather than
	allowing only a one-to-one mapping between paths and FS objects,
	this patch allows for one-to-many mappings, linking FS objects
	together in a linked list for the same path.
	
	At present, only the top layer on the stack, for a given FSIO
	operation, will be used.  I anticipate that it will be the
	responsibility of the called FSIO handler to decide whether it
	wants to act as a filter handler, and pass the parameters farther
	down the stack, or whether it wants to act as a source/sink handler
	and handle the parameters entirely by itself.  This behavior allows
	for backward compatibility with existing FSIO modules.

2004-11-13 14:41  castaglia

	* modules/mod_delay.c: 
	Use proper grammar.

2004-11-11 10:58  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES, modules/mod_log.c: 
	Make "SECURE" an alias for "SEC" when configuring ExtendedLog
	logging classes.

2004-11-10 18:44  castaglia

	* include/table.h, src/main.c, src/table.c: 
	Add a function, pr_table_nalloc(), to the Table API which allows
	for allocating a table with the given number of chains. 
	Previously, callers would need to call pr_table_alloc(), then
	pr_table_ctl() to resize the number of chains, and in doing so
	there would be a slight memory leak.  Now such callers can allocate
	the number of chains (usually smaller than the default of 32) as
	they need.

2004-11-04 14:48  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/data.h, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c:

	Removing deprecated directives.

2004-11-03 08:44  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Cleaning up the style of code in mod_sql.  It still needs work, as
	it's inconsistent and thus harder to read and maintain.

2004-11-02 19:18  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Check for, and record, the size of a size_t.

2004-11-02 17:54  castaglia

	* include/table.h, src/table.c: 
	When removing keys and entries from the table, rather than
	destroying their pools, add them to free lists, associated with the
	table itself.  Check these free lists when adding new keys and
	entries.  Thus the total memory for a table is proportional to the
	total number of entries ever used at one time, and we don't have as
	much memory churn from the destroying of pools.  The pool members
	of the key and entry structs have thus been removed.
	
	Also handle signals while iterating through the table chains in
	pr_table_empty().

2004-11-02 16:40  castaglia

	* include/default_paths.h: 
	Remove an unused macro, and its accompanying crufty comment.

2004-11-02 10:18  castaglia

	utils/ftpshut.c, utils/ftptop.c, utils/ftpwho.c,
	utils/scoreboard.c, utils/utils.h: 
	Moving many of the macros defining default paths into the 'PR_'
	namespace.  This isn't an issue now, but will become one when
	proftpd installs its header files into the production location,
	which will allow DSO modules to be built outside of the proftpd
	source tree.  When that happens, the likelihood of symbol
	collisions between ProFTPD macros/names and other files increases.

2004-11-01 20:01  castaglia

	* Makefile.in: 
	No need to invoke modules/Makefile's 'shared-modules' target if
	there are no shared module to build.

2004-11-01 19:35  castaglia

	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	More tweaks to get builds using just --with-modules to work again.

2004-11-01 19:23  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-01 19:15  castaglia

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, lib/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	Need to properly handle the case where the user might specify
	--with-modules, and no --with-shared.  In this case, the
	$(SHARED_MODULE_OBJS) variable will be empty, which was not being
	handled.

2004-11-01 09:48  castaglia

	* NEWS, README.DSO: 
	Mention the addition of DSO support in NEWS, and start on an
	accompanying README.DSO.  There will eventually appear a DSO

2004-11-01 09:42  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-11-01 09:38  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, Makefile.in, configure.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	Adding support for a --with-shared configure option, for building
	DSO (aka shared) modules.

2004-11-01 09:30  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Calling lt_dlexit() in a 'core.exit' event handler caused proftpd
	to segfault when shutting down.  All of the stashed module *m
	pointers for dynamically loaded modules become invalid after a call
	to lt_dlexit(), and those pointers can be used after mod_dso's exit
	handler.  The solution (though not clean) is to not call
	lt_dlexit().

2004-11-01 09:21  castaglia

	* src/display.c: 
	Bad reuse of variable name.

2004-11-01 09:12  castaglia

	* include/var.h: 
	Forgot to declare the pr_var_delete() function.

2004-10-31 14:39  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	The dso_unload_module() function is only used if the 'rmmod'
	control action is used, which means that it requires Controls
	support.  Otherwise, we don't need it.

2004-10-31 14:36  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Remove an unnecessary function.

2004-10-31 14:27  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Report the line number of the <IfDefine>, <IfModule> sections used

2004-10-31 14:26  castaglia

	* include/parser.h, src/parser.c: 
	Add a function to the Parser API for getting the current line
	number.  This is useful for better reporting.

2004-10-31 14:11  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Some of the loop variables are only used if Controls support is

	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 14:00  castaglia

	* aclocal.m4: 
	Update our local autoconf macros, specifically those dealing with
	libtool.  This should fix the warning:
	
	  libtool: link: warning: `AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN' not used. Assuming no
	dlopen support.
	
	that I was seeing.

2004-10-31 13:22  castaglia

	* src/table.c: 
	Quell a compiler warning about "use of cast expressions as lvalues"
	by being explicit.

2004-10-31 13:06  castaglia

	* config.h.in, include/conf.h: 
	The configure script was checking for <inttypes.h>, but we were not
	recording whether it was present or not, or including the header if
	it was present.  Shame on us.

2004-10-31 12:58  castaglia

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	The building of modules should require the libltdl header or
	library.  Just libtool to handle the linking.

2004-10-31 12:56  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Add the display of PR_TUNABLE_RCVBUFSZ, PR_TUNABLE_SNDBUFSZ to the

	* configure:

2004-10-31 12:46  castaglia

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: 
	Attempting to get a DSO-enabled proftpd to link properly on
	platforms other than Linux by linking with libltdl as an object
	file, rather than linking against it as a library.

2004-10-31 12:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_log.c: 
	Since we're using %ld as a format, explicitly cast the value as a
	long int, rather than as a time_t.

2004-10-31 12:19  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 12:16  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, configure.in: 
	Let's move the definition of HAVE_CONFIG_H into Make.rules.  The
	ordering of HAVE_CONFIG_H in the flags is therefore nicer.

2004-10-31 12:13  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-31 12:11  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Define HAVE_CONFIG_H when compiling proftpd.  Some of the files

	subsequently some of the system headers needed.

2004-10-31 12:06  castaglia

	* configure:

2004-10-31 11:31  castaglia

2004-10-31 11:09  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in, include/options.h, src/data.c,
	src/dirtree.c: 
	First, fix a bug where session.xfer.buf was allocated as
	PR_TUNABLE_BUFFER_SIZE, rather than PR_TUNABLE_XFER_BUFFER_SIZE.
	
	Next, try to be smarter about the default value for
	PR_TUNABLE_XFER_BUFFER_SIZE.  The configure script now runs a small
	test program that uses getsockopt(2) to determine the sizes of a
	TCP socket's send and receive buffers.	The smaller of the two
	buffer sizes is used as the default value for
	PR_TUNABLE_XFER_BUFFER_SIZE; the --enable-transfer-buffer-size
	option will override this test.  The test program also records
	those send/receive buffer sizes in PR_TUNABLE_RCVBUFSZ and
	PR_TUNABLE_SNDBUFSZ, which were previously hardcoded to be 8K.

2004-10-31 11:03  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c: 
	Style nits: struct stat variables should be named 'st', and the
	'xlate' name for the ASCII handling routines is not appropriate in
	light of the i18n translation we will be needing.  It's more of a
	transformation, really.

2004-10-31 10:53  castaglia

	This also separates the code used for handling Display* files into

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Updating the release notes.  These still need some work.

2004-10-30 18:57  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Typo.

2004-10-30 18:39  castaglia

	* src/parser.c: 
	Update the license to reflect the proper original copyright
	holder(s).

2004-10-30 18:32  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, contrib/mod_ifsession.c, include/conf.h,
	include/dirtree.h, include/parser.h, modules/mod_core.c,
	src/dirtree.c, src/main.c, src/parser.c: 
	Separating the parser code out from src/dirtree.c into its own
	file, src/parser.c, with a proper header file documenting the API
	(include/parser.h).  Update the rest of the core code to use the
	new API as needed.

2004-10-30 17:57  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	There is not enough information to call resolve_deferred_dirs() at
	session init time.  This function is usually for expanding the
	tilde in path names, and at session init time, we don't know the
	user name for expansion.

2004-10-30 16:18  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Use pr_auth_getgroups(), not auth_getgroups().

2004-10-30 16:16  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c, contrib/mod_wrap.c, src/dirtree.c, src/fsio.c,
	src/support.c: 
	Use the Auth API functions in the 'pr_' namespace.

2004-10-30 16:14  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Use the Auth API functions in the 'pr_' namespace rather than
	relying on the compatibility macros.

2004-10-30 15:11  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-30 15:06  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	Tweaking the configure script a bit, providing more complete path
	information in flags, etc.  Not really needed for the default build
	process which we all know and love, but will become necessary when
	building DSO modules.

2004-10-30 14:55  castaglia

	* src/timers.c: 
	This struct is no longer typedef'd.

2004-10-30 14:01  castaglia

	* include/timers.h: 
	Include some redefines for supporting legacy modules that may not
	have been updated to use the 'pr_' namespace Timer API.

2004-10-30 13:57  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql_mysql.c, contrib/mod_sql_postgres.c,
	contrib/mod_tls.c, modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Update the contrib/ modules to use the Timer API in the 'pr_'
	namespace (and mod_ctrls, too).

2004-10-30 13:45  castaglia

	* include/timers.h, modules/mod_auth.c, modules/mod_core.c,
	modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c, src/ident.c, src/inet.c,
	src/main.c, src/timers.c: 
	Moving the Timer API into the 'pr_' namespace.

2004-10-30 13:44  castaglia

	* include/ftp.h: 
	In the near future, a module will implement support for RFC2640's
	LANG command.

2004-10-30 13:42  castaglia

	* include/version.h: 
	With the addition of DSO support, ProFTPD is now moving into the
	1.3.x series.  Whee!

2004-10-29 15:56  castaglia

	* ltmain.sh: 
	Yet another bug in GNU's ltmain.sh script -- yet another undeclared
	variable.

2004-10-29 15:33  castaglia

	* doc/modules/mod_dso.html: 
	Typo (spotted by Michael).

2004-10-29 15:23  castaglia

	* doc/modules/mod_dso.html: 
	Adding documentation for mod_dso.

2004-10-29 14:46  castaglia

	* src/event.c: 
	As a comment to myself indicated, it is necessary to pstrdup() the
	name of the event for which a listener is being registered, rather
	than stashing a pointer to the given name directly.  This was
	causing a segfault when the pointer to the name given was part of a
	dynamically loaded module.

2004-10-29 12:17  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	The DebugLevel configuration handler was not recognizing 10 as a
	valid debug level.

2004-10-29 09:08  castaglia

	* doc/modules/mod_ctrls.html: 
	Grammar fix.

2004-10-29 08:29  castaglia

	* modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Removing debugging cruft.

2004-10-29 08:21  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-28 23:01  castaglia

	* lib/libltdl/Makefile.in: 
	Disable the actions that try to use autoheader and automake.  These
	aren't installed on every system, and we don't really use them.

2004-10-28 22:51  castaglia

	* configure.in, lib/Makefile.in: 
	Only configure, build, and clean the libltdl/ directory if
	--enable-dso is selected.  Otherwise, let the build proceed as
	usual, and let the normal 'clean' target work without throwing an
	error.

2004-10-28 22:33  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-28 22:28  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, Makefile.in, config.h.in, configure.in,
	include/default_paths.h, lib/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	More DSO support changes.

2004-10-28 22:21  castaglia

	* ltmain.sh, modules/mod_dso.c: 
	Adding a (slightly modified) copy of ltmain.sh, which is
	responsible for creating the libtool executable.  Also adding
	mod_dso.c.  All part of the preparations for adding DSO support to
	ProFTPD.

2004-10-28 22:19  castaglia

	* aclocal.m4: 
	Adding GNU libtool M4 definitions to our aclocal.m4.

2004-10-28 22:17  castaglia

	* lib/libltdl/: COPYING.LIB, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, README,
	acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, config-h.in, config.guess, config.sub,
	configure, configure.ac, install-sh, ltdl.c, ltdl.h, ltmain.sh,
	missing: 
	Adding GNU libtool's libltdl files to ProFTPD.

2004-10-28 18:10  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	The checks for <IfDefine>, </IfDefine>, <IfModule>, and
	</IfModule>, within the respective directive handlers, need to be
	case-insensitive.

2004-10-28 12:11  castaglia

	* NEWS, utils/ftptop.c: 
	Bug#2484 - Better ftptop formatting.

2004-10-26 18:49  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Typo.

2004-10-26 16:24  castaglia

	* include/dirtree.h, include/modules.h, include/proftpd.h,
	modules/mod_site.c, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Removing old privdata_t structures in favor of table entries, using
	the new Table API.

2004-10-26 15:28  castaglia

	* configure: 
	Updating configure.

2004-10-26 15:19  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Define CONFIG_DIR to point to the hardcoded directory containing
	the proftpd.conf file.

2004-10-26 15:14  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/conf.h, include/table.h, src/table.c: 
	Adding the Table API source.

2004-10-19 18:32  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	It is possible for SSL_read() to return SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE as
	well, so handle that case the same way as handling
	SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ: select() on the socket until it is available
	for writing, then call SSL_read() again.
	
	Note that this happens (ideally) only when a renegotiation is
	occuring on the underlying SSL session.  So set the
	SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY mode too (if the OpenSSL version supports it),
	which will hopefully keep renegotiations from causing SSL_read() to
	return SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.

2004-10-18 09:42  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	A few cases where log_pri() was being used, rather than
	pr_log_pri().

2004-10-17 16:42  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Directory.html: 
	Mention using quotations to enclose directory paths that contain
	spaces.

2004-10-17 16:29  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Bug#1965 - Change timing of handling of QUIT command.

2004-10-17 12:09  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Extraneous redeclaration of a variable.

2004-10-17 10:47  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Fixing bad reuse of variable name from outer scope.

2004-10-16 18:21  castaglia

	* RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Mention the new MaxConnectionsPerHost directive in the release
	notes.

2004-10-16 18:10  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Bug#2273 - Ability to limit number of unauthenticated clients from
	a single host.

2004-10-15 17:43  castaglia

	Bug#2497 - Users can login without password if pam_start() fails.

2004-10-15 10:07  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/auth.c, src/dirtree.c: 
	Bug#2499 - make_cmd() does not NULL-terminate cmd->argv[].

2004-10-14 19:43  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Move the handling of the AccessGrantMsg and DisplayLogin directives
	into the POST_CMD handler for PASS, rather than in the CMD handler.
	 This is aesthetically where such handling should occur, and it
	makes it possible for future enhancements where contrib modules can
	add their own variables to be interpolated into the DisplayLogin
	file.

2004-10-11 20:07  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Nicer error message.

2004-10-11 10:03  castaglia

	* src/bindings.c: 
	Avoid an infinite loop problem with Bind is used by stashing
	pointers to the bindings to use, when accepting a client
	connection, in an array_header, rather than overloading the 'next'
	field in the conn_t struct.

2004-10-11 09:33  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Fix case where the config tree was not dumped if the server_rec had
	an empty set of config_recs.  The name of the server_rec should
	still be dumped in such cases.

2004-10-09 15:34  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Update link to FTPS Draft.

2004-10-09 15:24  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	The parser internals are crufty, and are in need of rewriting and
	prettification.  Until then, make the code a little more legible
	(to me, at least).

2004-10-09 13:46  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/inet.h, include/netio.h, src/data.c, src/inet.c,
	src/netio.c: 
	Bug#2494 - ABOR problem with Cisco routers copy ftp flash.

2004-10-09 13:44  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Generate a 'core.connect' event after a client has connected and
	we've forked, but before we lookup the server_rec for the session.

2004-10-08 18:16  jwm

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c: release 2.8.14

2004-10-07 14:17  castaglia

	Explicitly mention "RequireValidShell off" if the given shell is
	not in /etc/shells.

2004-10-07 11:59  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2496 - NLST off-by-one bug when handling relative paths in a
	chrooted session.

2004-10-07 11:35  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.html: 
	Remove mention of the PERCALL parameter of SQLConnectInfo, until
	the feature actually works.

2004-10-07 08:53  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Use the Auth API in the 'pr_' namespace.

2004-10-06 11:42  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.html: 
	Removing mention of SQLAuthenticate's "*" suffix, as it was
	deprecated in the 1.2.10 release cycle.

2004-10-02 13:22  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Handle signals when in potentially infinite gotos, so that the
	process can be interrupted.
	
	Expand the TLSLog entry for refused PROT commands a little more, to
	explain why the PROT command was refused (e.g. 'PROT C' was sent,
	but TLSRequired setting requires data protection).

2004-10-02 13:05  castaglia

	* doc/howto/TLS.html: 
	Adding two more FAQs to the TLS howto.

2004-10-01 22:48  castaglia

	Fix the logic when reporting on syscall errors, so that the errors
	are properly reported.

2004-10-01 20:34  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Stop sending 232 as a response code to the PASS command; it is
	valid only in response to a USER command.  Part of Bug #2164.

2004-10-01 20:30  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Remove code that is never compiled.

2004-09-30 17:43  castaglia

	Bug#2492 - Off-by-one error in FreeBSD PAM username length check.

2004-09-29 14:04  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/dirtree.c: 
	Bug#2490 - <Limit ALL> affects PORT command.  The EPRT, EPSV, PORT,

	group.

2004-09-27 18:25  jwm

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_ldap.c: new mod_ldap 2.8.13

2004-09-27 10:12  castaglia

	Use the 'pr_' namespace of the Auth API.

2004-09-26 13:23  castaglia

	Removing code that should not have been committed.  Oops.

2004-09-26 13:11  castaglia

	* include/auth.h, include/conf.h, include/modules.h,
	modules/mod_auth.c, src/auth.c: 
	Moving the Auth API into the 'pr_' namespace, and creating a
	separate header file defining the pr_auth function prototypes.

2004-09-26 11:24  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_sql.c, contrib/mod_sql_mysql.c,

	early.

2004-09-26 11:17  castaglia

2004-09-26 10:57  castaglia

	* src/mkhome.c: 
	Generate a 'core.create-home' event when creating a home directory;

	being created.	And correct a typo.

2004-09-18 12:08  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_quotatab.c: 
	When handling the 'core.restart' event, do not bounce the log file
	descriptor.  Restarts are processed by the daemon process, and
	mod_quotatab only logs in session processes; bouncing the log
	descriptor in the daemon process was causing mod_quotatab to open a
	descriptor onto stdout, which then wreaked havoc with the rest of
	the system.

	* config.h.in, include/conf.h: 
	Move the HPUX socklen_t bug fix to include/conf.h, a header file
	that is not preprocessed by autoconf.  The autoconf preprocessing
	was causing the #undef in the generated config.h header file to be

	compilers.

2004-09-04 19:23  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Remove the _MOD_VERSION #define from mod_sql, as it was not doing

	to have each module #define its own VERSION string, and to use that
	version string consistently within the module.

	The Regexp API need not use the core_module pointer for registering
	its callbacks; registered events can have a NULL module pointer.

2004-08-25 11:08  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	When using sendfile(), only reset the transmission timers if bytes
	have actually been written out.  sendfile() can return zero,
	indicating that it wrote zero bytes -- we do not want to reset the
	timers in this case, for it could indicate other issues with the
	file descriptor from which data are being read.
	
	This fixes an endless loop seen at a particular site involving use
	of sendfile() and NFS/SAN-shared files.

2004-08-24 15:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Reset the 'have_prot' flag to false when a successful PROT C
	command is processed.

2004-08-12 16:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Update to patch to mod_xfer for Bug #2444: the PROT command is

	authentication first, causing issutes for FTPS clients that sent
	PROT before USER.

2004-08-07 15:21  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Two more cases where the IP address contacted by the client should
	be used, if present, rather than the ServerAddress field of the
	relevant server_rec.

2004-08-07 13:58  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Fix a minor bug in the reporting of ServerIdent, where the wrong IP
	address may be displayed.  For example, with the following
	configuration:
	
	  <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
	    Bind 1.2.3.4
	    ...
	  </VirtualHost>
	
	a client connecting to 1.2.3.4 should see "[127.0.0.1]" at the tail
	end of the default ServerIdent displayed, rather than the more
	appropriate "[1.2.3.4]".  The fix is to use the IP address to which
	the client connected, rather than the ServerAddress field of the
	server_rec to which the client connected.  As the case with Bind
	shows, multiple IP addresses may be associated with the same
	server_rec, and the IP address displayed to the connecting client
	should not "leak" this fact.

2004-08-05 19:16  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Reorder the timing of calling pr_ident_lookup(), making it occur
	after modules have been initialized.  This makes it possible for
	mod_ifsession, for example, to alter if ident lookups will be
	enabled, e.g.:
	
	  <IfClass foo>
	    IdentLookups off
	  </IfClass>
	
	so that ident lookups can be enabled/disabled selectively.

	 Using gcc on AIX5, these files compile without complaint. 
	However, using the IBM compiler and following the instructions in

	the portability hack that is done for AIX4.

	* NEWS, include/modules.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/auth.c: 
	Bug #2440 - Unable to use PAM authentication properly.	As
	explained in the bug report, the deprecation of all *Authoritative
	directives causes an issue with modules like mod_auth_pam.  This

2004-06-30 19:00  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Fix pr_expr_eval_class_and() and pr_expr_eval_class_or() to
	properly handle the case where session.class may be NULL (as when
	there is no <Class> definition that matches the connecting client).
	 Previously, if there was no matching <Class> for a client, a rule
	such as:
	
	  <IfClass !name>
	
	would evaluate to false.  It _should_ evaluate to true; this change
	makes it so.
	
	This fixes a problem Michael was encountering with mod_ifsession
	and Classes.

2004-06-30 18:52  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	When handling <Global> contexts in fixup_globals(), only handle
	contexts that have both the right config_type (CONF_GLOBAL) _and_
	the right name ("<Global>").  Contrib modules (e.g. mod_ifsession)
	might create their own contexts that use the CONF_GLOBAL flag; in
	the case of mod_ifsession, the fact that fixup_globals() was
	handling the mod_ifsession-created context config_recs was causing
	a bug when <If*> sections were used within <Global> contexts.
	
	This change also includes some style cleanup.

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_quotatab_sql.c, contrib/mod_sql.c,
	include/support.h, src/support.c: 
	Bug#2420 - Name field is not escaped before querying database.
	
	This patch fixes mod_quotatab_sql to escape the name string used. 
	To do this, several changes were made: the _sql_strip_spaces()
	function of mod_sql.c was made a public ProFTPD API string function
	(pr_str_strip), so that that code need not be duplicated in both
	mod_sql.c and mod_quotatab_sql.c, a new HOOK to mod_sql's
	sql_escapestring function was added, under the symbol
	'sql_escapestr', to avoid further code duplication, and
	mod_quotatab_sql was updated to make use of the new API.

2004-05-31 14:49  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	Removing the 'dump' control action from mod_ctrls_admin.  A new

	When iterating through the stash for removing symbols, be sure to

2004-05-31 10:54  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	Fix a bug introduced in the handling of HOOK vs CMD symbols.  Fix

2004-05-31 10:47  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	Missed a case where the PR_SYM_CONF hashing needed to be handled
	differently.

2004-05-30 18:51  castaglia

	* src/modules.c: 
	The changes made earlier, to have processing of configuration
	directives use the stash directly, caused a problem.  The prior
	structure allowed for case-insensitive comparisons between the
	directive name in the config file and the name defined by the
	processing module.  By switching to doing lookups from the stash
	directly, such case-insensitive comparisons became difficult.
	
	So, for now, whenever a PR_SYM_CONF symbol is added or requested
	from the stash, its hash value is calculated not from the symbol
	name directly, but from a lowercased version of the name (and only
	for PR_SYM_CONF symbols).  In order to make this work, there is now
	special-case handling of PR_SYM_CONF, and the stash_lookup()
	functions use strcasecmp() rather than strcmp().  I hope this
	doesn't cause any problems with other symbols.
	
	In the future, when the proposed Tables API is complete, I'd like
	to have completely separate tables for the different symbol types. 
	This will (hopefully) make lookups faster (smaller namespace to
	search) and allow customized hashing/comparison functions
	(PR_SYM_CONF symbols needing different treatment from other symbols
	in this case) on a per-table basis.

2004-05-30 15:46  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c, include/modules.h, modules/mod_core.c,
	src/modules.c: 
	Add pr_module_load() and pr_module_unload() functions, for loading
	and unloading modules (and their symbols) from the stash.  Rework
	the rest of the code to work with the changes (i.e. removed crufty
	globals).

	* src/main.c: 
	Typo.

2004-05-30 14:45  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Bug#2125 - -vv command line switch should list versions of modules.
	
	With this change, modules _can_ report their version (or other
	short descriptor)in such a way that it will be listed if the -vv
	command line option is used.  It is not required for modules to do
	so; if they do not, just the module name is displayed.

2004-05-30 14:34  castaglia

	* include/modules.h: 
	Extend the module structure to include fields for module version,
	and an opage handle for the module (for libltdl pointers).  This
	extension do not break the currently-defined module structures in
	module files.

2004-05-29 19:39  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c, src/dirtree.c, src/modules.c,
	src/sets.c: 
	More prep work for loadable modules.  This change removes use of
	the m_conftable global variable, shifting the users of that
	variable to using the stash directly, via pr_stash_get_symbol(). 
	For example, mod_ctrls_admin was using m_conftable for supporting
	the 'get directives' control action.  Now that handler iterates
	through the stash directly for PR_SYM_CONF symbols (which required
	some adjusting of the stash internals to allow for such
	interating).

2004-05-29 16:38  castaglia

	* src/event.c:

	More fun with the loaded_modules list.	Initially, the
	loaded_modules linked list will be NULL; it is the job of
	modules_init() to initialize the modules in the static_modules

	list.
	
	More work needs to be done on abstracting the process of loading of
	a module.

2004-05-29 15:31  castaglia

2004-05-29 14:02  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, modules/glue.sh, modules/mod_core.c,
	modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Beginning work on supporting loadable modules.	The modules/glue.sh
	file autogenerates a file that defines the static_modules array,
	which contains the module structure pointers from all the
	statically compiled modules.  This list cannot be modified.  For
	loadable modules, we need a modifiable list, which I've added to
	the script: loaded_modules.  Initially, loaded_modules is identical
	to static_modules.  A pr_module_get() function has been added, to
	lookup a module pointer given its name.

2004-05-29 12:52  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Add more info to the ControlsLog when the ControlsAuthFreshness is
	exceeded, to help in debugging why this happens.

2004-05-29 11:55  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Typo (thanks John!).

2004-05-28 21:22  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Directory.html: 
	Wording update.

2004-05-28 21:19  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Fix handling of memory passed to mlock(2).  It seems that mlock(2)
	is very picky, and wants a page-aligned address only. 
	malloc(3)/calloc(3) do not return page-aligned addresses by default
	(although FreeBSD's man page suggests that for a sufficient size
	request, they will), so we help them along by adding some
	page-alignment code.  We still want to stash the pointer returned
	by malloc(), not the aligned address, so that we can properly free
	the allocated memory later.
	
	Also use pr_log_debug(), rather than logging to the TLSLog, when
	locking passphrases into memory, for at that point in the server
	lifecycle, the TLSLog has not yet been opened.

2004-05-28 18:56  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Silence a compiler warning by providing a default value.

2004-05-28 18:55  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Typo.

2004-05-28 17:28  castaglia

	* src/scoreboard.c: 
	Unblock signals properly.

2004-05-28 09:46  castaglia

	* README.modules: 
	Update this README.

2004-05-27 10:20  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Registering for the wrong event: we want 'core.postparse', not
	'core.restart'.  Close the TLSLog during a restart, so that it can
	be rolled.  The TLSLog will be reopened by the next session.

2004-05-26 12:25  castaglia

	* src/ctrls.c: 
	Make sure that the destination ctrl object has a valid temporary
	pool from which to copy arguments.

2004-05-26 11:54  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Reset the sid (server ID) counter when preparing to parse a

	* configure: 
	Updating configure script.

2004-05-25 19:15  castaglia

	* config.h.in, configure.in: 
	Check if intptr_t is defined.

2004-05-25 16:31  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	When closing fds, set them to -1, to make sure that a cached fd
	value is not inadvertently used somewhere it shouldn't be.  Also,
	block alarms when handling the 'core.restart' event.

2004-05-25 16:00  castaglia

	* doc/howto/BCP.html: 
	Wording.

2004-05-25 10:17  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Make sure that fixup_servers() happens before generating the
	'core.postparse' event (mod_tls' 'core.postparse' handler was
	tickling a segfault because one of the server_recs had a NULL
	ServerName field; fixup_servers() sets all of the server_rec fields
	appropriately).

2004-05-24 16:27  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Fix a problem when restarting a proftpd with mod_ctrls.  Some
	variables were allocated from the module pool, and then being used
	after that pool had been destroyed/reallocated.  This meant that
	different configurations and interactions might (or might not)
	work.

2004-05-24 14:35  castaglia

	* lib/pr-syslog.c:

	Update the release notes with mention of TimeoutLinger.

2004-05-21 10:19  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/data.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/data.c: 
	Add a TimeoutLinger option.  It's just simpler to change this value
	via the config file, for those sites that encounter troubles with
	lingering closes, rather than requiring a reconfigure and
	recompile.

2004-05-20 10:28  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	Check for signals while waiting for all kids to end when handling a
	graceful shutdown.

	* doc/howto/: Controls.html, index.html: 
	Add a Controls howto.

	Make sure a Class has been assigned before attempting to use it.

2004-05-19 10:07  castaglia

	* NEWS, lib/pr-syslog.c, src/main.c: 
	Bug#2336 - Use of /dev/log on Solaris leads to kernel memory leak.

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Style.

2004-05-18 16:22  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Typo.

2004-05-18 15:43  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Document that 'ftpdctl get' accepts both 'config' and 'directives'
	parameters.

2004-05-17 11:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c, src/main.c: 
	Generate events when the Timeout* callbacks cause the session to
	time out.

2004-05-15 10:25  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Fix an edge case when handling ASCII translation: if this buffer
	ends in a CR, and the next buffer starts with an LF, we need not
	add a CR in front of the LF.  Prior to this change, though, proftpd
	would forget about that dangling CR in the previous buffer, treat
	the LF as a bare LF, and add a CR, resulting in a CR-CR-LF sequence
	in the output stream rather than the proper CR-LF.

2004-05-13 07:01  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c, include/modules.h, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Remove the explicit postparse callback registration code in favor
	of the new Events API.

2004-05-12 19:58  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Use more future-proof APIs to access the X509v3 subjectAltNames in
	the client cert.  Properly NUL-terminate strings obtained from
	memory BIOs.

2004-05-12 18:13  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth.c, src/mkhome.c: 
	Bug#2410 - CreateHome always copies skel directory.

2004-05-11 19:20  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	I don't think this is valid anymore, if it ever was.  The
	IPV6_ADDRFORM socket option is not supported on FreeBSD or Solaris,
	and looks to be deprecated (if not removed entirely) in later Linux
	kernels.

2004-05-11 16:37  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_auth_file.c, modules/mod_auth_unix.c: 
	Bug#2407 - mod_auth_file does not allow for proper cascading of
	"end" and "set" auth requests

2004-05-11 09:56  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Removing the daemon startup registration handlers; these have been
	superceded by Events (e.g. the "core.startup" event).

2004-05-10 10:50  castaglia

	* NEWS, src/main.c: 
	Bug#2332 - SO_OOBINLINE error after upgrading proftpd from 1.2.6 to
	1.2.9.	Attempt to fix by moving the setting of these socket
	options to happen earlier in the session.

2004-05-09 13:05  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	When opening a data connection, check for the ESPV ALL mode as
	well.

2004-05-08 18:07  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	When looking up the FS to use for a path, always start with the
	root FS ("/") as the best FS to handle the path.  This fixes a bug
	where the FS handlers registered by modules like mod_md5fs or
	mod_gzipfs were being used for paths other than those for which
	they were registered.
	
	Also fix a bug where an FS that did not start with a '/', such as
	one used by mod_conf_sql, would cause the FSIO API to prepend the
	current location when it shouldn't have; the FSIO API simply needed
	to use the proper check for whether the given path was an absolute
	path or not.

2004-05-07 20:21  castaglia

	* contrib/: mod_sql_mysql.c, mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Style cleanup of the SQL backend modules.  Also updating them to
	use an event handler for the "core.exit" event.
	
	Fixed their session initialization routines to always allocate a
	new conn_pool and a new conn_cache.  Eventually the mod_sql API
	will be revamped to handle these structures a little better.

2004-05-07 14:31  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2366 - Add support for -h list option.

2004-05-07 11:17  castaglia

	Redeclaring a variable isn't a good thing to do.

2004-05-06 20:36  castaglia

	* src/child.c: 
	Include <signal.h> so that the kill(2) function prototype is
	visible.

2004-05-06 08:35  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Bug#2405 - "LIST *" should not list dotfiles.

2004-05-05 10:49  castaglia

	* src/child.c: 
	Fix the logic determining when to create a new child list.  Also,
	when creating that list, use a subpool of the child_pool, rather
	than passing child_pool itself; the list allocator assigns the
	given pool into the list's 'pool' member, rather than creating a
	subpool from the given pool and allocating the list from what
	(which is how I would expect it to be done).

2004-05-04 09:54  castaglia

	* lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	The buffer length should be PR_TUNABLE_LOGIN_MAX + 1.

2004-05-03 19:59  castaglia

	* lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	Patch the bundled glob implementation to use PR_TUNABLE_LOGIN_MAX
	when the _SC_LOGIN_MAX sysconf variable is not available.  This
	brings the implementation more in line with the rest of proftpd.

2004-05-03 10:25  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/class.h, src/class.c, src/main.c: 
	Bug#2403 - Sending SIGHUP to proftpd stops it when using Classes.

2004-05-02 08:05  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_rewrite.c, contrib/mod_rewrite.html:

2004-05-01 20:39  castaglia

	* include/glibc-glob.h: 
	Quell some warnings seen on FreeBSD by checking that a preprocessor
	symbol (_FILE_OFFSET_BITS) is defined before using its value in a
	comparison.

2004-05-01 11:44  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Only report the version of OpenSSL being used at debug level 2 or
	higher.

	adding a convenience function to the Child API, child_signal(), for
	sending a given signal to all child processes.

2004-04-29 13:09  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html: 
	Typo.

2004-04-29 12:28  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, include/child.h, include/conf.h, src/child.c,
	src/main.c: 
	Move the handling of child objects into their own file.  This will
	help by letting modules be able to know how many existing sessions
	there are.  However, the child list routines will not be in the
	public "pr_" namespace, as they are not currently suitable for
	general consumption.

2004-04-28 20:35  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ldap.c, include/sets.h, modules/mod_auth_unix.c,
	src/dirtree.c, src/main.c, src/sets.c, src/support.c: 
	Rename crufty 'mempool' symbol to be 'pool', which is more
	consistent with the pool members of other proftpd structures.

2004-04-28 20:35  castaglia

	* README.IPv6: 
	Note the sysctl names that affect handling of wildcard sockets and
	IPv6 binds.  The current code should override these sysctl
	settings, but it is still good to have the sysctl names noted for
	reference.

2004-04-28 18:55  castaglia

2004-04-28 10:52  castaglia

	* README, RELEASE_NOTES: 
	Add a RELEASE_NOTES file (name may change in the future) that will
	track the sort of comments usually mentioned in the release
	announcement email, including new and deprecated configuration
	directives, new and deprecated modules, upgrade notes, etc.
	
	Add a note about RELEASE_NOTES to the README.

	occurrences of 500 responses in mod_xfer.

2004-04-26 16:33  castaglia

	* include/dirtree.h, src/dirtree.c: 
	Split the Boolean checking code into a public function, so that it
	can be used for checking strings from sources other than cmd_recs.

2004-04-23 18:17  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Do not warn about a successful root login until after root has
	indeed successfully logged in.

2004-04-23 18:13  castaglia

	* doc/modules/mod_auth_pam.html: 
	Add HTML docs for mod_auth_pam.

2004-04-23 14:29  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	The prior fix for Bug#2367 has some unintended (i.e. _bad_)
	consequence, spotted by Michael.  This fixes it up properly
	(hopefully for good).

2004-04-23 13:46  castaglia

	* src/netacl.c: 
	The '{' character is also used in globs.

2004-04-23 11:35  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Write a debug message, level 1, when NLST commands with options (as
	from ncftp) are received.

2004-04-22 18:32  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Protect against a possible segfault that occurs when mod_sql
	assumes that a query has data, by checking for a valid data pointed
	in the returned modret_t object.

2004-04-21 18:32  castaglia

	* src/inet.c: 
	Only set the TOS (Type Of Service) flags on IPv4 sockets; IPv6
	sockets don't support TOS flags, as far as I know.  This should fix
	the
	
	  error setting write fd IP_TOS: Option not supported by protocol
	
	errors seen on some platforms (e.g. Solaris).

2004-04-21 14:29  castaglia

	* doc/howto/: index.html, Classes.html: 
	Add a howto for the new <Class> format.

2004-04-20 18:23  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Style cleanup.

2004-04-20 18:15  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Capture the actual errno value, rather than assuming that
	intervening functions will not change errno.

2004-04-20 16:26  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Limit.html: 
	Consistency of style is a Good Thing.

2004-04-20 13:57  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c: 
	If the 'dump classes' control action is requested, make sure that
	the Class dump output includes the Satisfy setting.

2004-04-19 19:05  castaglia

	* src/log.c: 
	Fix the logging of IP addresses in the utmp/wtmp log on Linux. 
	Formatting cleanup.

2004-04-19 16:59  castaglia

	* include/class.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/class.c: 
	Add a Satisfy directive.  Note that this directive does NOT
	function like Apache's Satisfy directive.  This current
	implementation is to be used when defining a class, to specify how
	to evaluate all of the rules of the class: any, or all.
	
	Future work will overload this directive to work as users would
	like (see Bug#1898) for the <Limit> context.

2004-04-19 16:33  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Report line numbers when parsing .ftpaccess files, too.

2004-04-18 10:00  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Have the fatal messages reported during configuration parsing
	report the line number and configuration file, for easier fixing of
	broken configs.

2004-04-16 09:33  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/privs.h: 
	Bug#2317 - Wrong order of privs calls on HP generates "unable to
	setregid()".  error.  The problem turned out to be a call to
	setregid() before a call to setreuid(), but only in the HP privs
	code (non-seteuid() case).  The fix was trivial: call setreuid()
	first, to make sure the proper UIDs are set, then call setregid().

2004-04-15 18:08  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Mention in NEWS the new doc/modules/ directory.

2004-04-15 16:16  castaglia

	* include/ctrls.h: 
	These changes should've been part of an earlier commit.

2004-04-15 15:19  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	The features listed under "future work" have been implemented.

2004-04-15 15:14  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_tls.c: 
	Much improved handling of OpenSSL's error queue, so that the TLSLog
	can properly show all of the errors in the queue (rather than just
	the top error, which is usually not too helpful in pinpointing the
	actual problem).

2004-04-15 14:31  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	Document the flags parameters for RewriteCondition, RewriteRule. 
	Also document the possible pattern variants allowed for
	RewriteCondition.  Add an example of using mod_rewrite to make all
	uploaded files have uppercased filenames.

2004-04-15 11:46  castaglia

	* sample-configurations/basic.conf: 
	The default configuration file should not allow use of SITE CHMOD.

2004-04-15 10:33  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_rewrite.html: 
	Formatting typo.

2004-04-14 19:47  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Cleanup the error reported if the PidFile cannot be opened.

2004-04-14 13:25  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Michael suggested that this log message be at the INFO level.

2004-04-14 11:11  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.c, modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/ctrls.c: 
	Remove the unused 'set' control action from mod_ctrls_admin.  Make
	the 'lsctrl' control action list only enabled control actions. 
	Initialize the ControlsSocketACL such that access to the socket is
	allowed to everyone by default; access to individual control
	actions still defaults to "deny" unless access is explicitly
	granted via configuration.

2004-04-13 13:19  castaglia

	* doc/howto/Filters.html: 
	Emphasize _not_ using both an Allow and a Deny Filter at the same
	time.

2004-04-13 10:55  castaglia

	* include/privs.h: 
	Revert part of my previous update to privs.h; it included a

	committed just yet.

2004-04-13 10:52  castaglia

	Add a SID (Server ID) to every server_rec.  This SID is a unique ID
	that is automatically assigned to each generated server_rec when
	proftpd parses its configuration.  SIDs are useful for tracking
	purposes, particularly for contrib modules that want to track which
	vhost caused something to happen.
	
	Format/style cleanups, removed unused CLASS_USER #define.

2004-04-13 09:46  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ctrls.c: 
	Consistent use of strcmp().  Use ANY_MODULE where appropriate,
	rather than NULL.

2004-04-12 10:14  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Fix pr_fsio_getline() to handle the case where a config line,
	broken across several lines in the config file using line
	continuations, has one of the lines commented out, e.g.:
	
	   SomeDirective \
	     foo \
	   #  bar \
	     baz
	
	Without this patch, pr_fsio_getline() would return the '#'
	character, which is not what most people would think would happen.

2004-04-12 10:09  castaglia

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	Be a little more strict when checking for "${env:...}" strings in

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Make the 'core.signal.USR2' event handler check for new
	TransferRates when involved in any of the file data transfer
	commands (APPE, RETR, STOR, STOU), not just RETR.  Update comments
	as well.

2004-04-11 13:42  castaglia

	* NEWS, modules/mod_ctrls.c, src/ctrls.c: 
	Bug#2383 - mod_ctrls.c: ctrls_listen(): Invalid size in bind()
	argument.

2004-04-11 13:35  castaglia

	* modules/mod_xfer.c: 
	Add a handler for the event 'core.signal.USR2' to mod_xfer.  The
	handler causes mod_xfer, if and only if the RETR command is
	currently being handled, to rescan the config tree for TransferRate
	entries.
	
	The 'core.signal.USR2' event is only generated when Controls have
	been enabled, so in most cases this won't change anything.  Its
	purpose is mainly to help the mod_shaper module be able to change
	the TransferRate for a session in mid-transfer.

2004-04-11 13:27  castaglia

	* include/dirtree.h, src/dirtree.c: 
	Add a new merge flag, CF_SILENT.  Unlike the rest of the CF_ flags,
	this flag is handled by fixup_dirs(); the other CF_ flags are
	handled by the internal _reorder_dirs() function.  When
	fixup_dirs() sees CF_SILENT, it will not print a debug
	configuration dump, which is its default behavior.

2004-04-11 13:22  castaglia

	* src/event.c: 
	Make sure that the order of event registration matches module load
	order.	This helps when the same event may be handled by multiple

2004-04-05 10:59  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c, src/scoreboard.c: 
	Check for an error return value from pr_rewind_scoreboard().
	
	Keep track of the process which opened the cached scoreboard fd. 
	It's possible to have the daemon process open the fd, and then
	fork, which means the child will have that same fd.  However, the
	child may fdopen() another file onto that fd (e.g. if the fd is 0),
	thus losing the scoreboard fd.	This patch also prevents the
	possibility of a file descriptor leak by having the same process
	open the scoreboard multiple times (e.g. when multiple modules call
	pr_open_scoreboard()).

	  CreateHome on skel /etc/ftpd/skel dirmode 700
	
	However, the current CreateHome implementation assumes that the
	parameter after the Boolean will always be the mode.  This change
	makes the config handler check for any preceding 'skel' or
	'dirmode' keywords before trying to process that parameter as the
	mode.  Hopefully now the examples will work properly.

	data, and quotatab_read() would degrade that write-lock to a
	read-lock, then release it completely, leaving the actual write
	operation unprotected by a lock.  This patch fixes the contention
	in the locking routinese by having them check and set a static
	variable.

	* include/proftpd.h, src/main.c: 
	Tweak the handling of SIGUSR2 a little.  If controls are not
	enabled, keep the current behavior: the proftpd process will print
	a memory dump.	If controls are enabled, generate a
	"core.signal.USR2" event, which will allow modules to register
	multiple handlers for this same event.	This way, mod_ctrls_common
	can use SIGUSR2 to get other proftpd processes to print memory
	dumps, and thus keeping the ability to get memory dumps from any
	proftpd process.  Without this change, if controls are enabled, we
	can only get a memory dump of the daemon process (and most of the
	time, it is the session processes in which we are interested).

	(filesystem),
	    which allows the open/creat handlers to store file-specific
	data in
	    the handle (fh->fh_data), which was not possible when using the
	    filesystem pointer.
	  + added a new function, pr_remove_fs(), for removing a filesystem

	* modules/mod_auth_file.c: 
	The new group membership debugging found a bug: mod_auth_file, when
	scanning an AuthGroupFile, would only add the group name if the ID
	for the group was different from the user's primary GID.  For GID
	stuff, this is fine; however, for group expressions in proftpd.conf
	that may rely on those group names, it's a bug.
	
	This allows for an interesting situation: assign a user to multiple
	groups with different names, but the same GID.	Thus you can
	workaround the NGROUPS_MAX system limit using a long list of group
	names; the operating system won't notice, and proftpd will happily
	check the names.  Nice.

	for systems that use gethostbyname2() (e.g. the BSDs, some Linux

	resolved to their names.
	
	Bug#2242 - Parsing during rehashing was failing with an EPERM.	The
	problem was that configuration directive handlers (specifically,
	SyslogFacility and SystemLog) were using PRIVS_RELINQUISH, which
	caused later Includes to fail.	Configuration handlers should not
	use the PRIVS macros.

2003-10-11 12:27  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	When performing reverse DNS lookups on IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses,
	we need to be a little more careful about which checks are
	performed.  This change alters the call to gethostbyname2() (when
	it is present) to be AF_INET if the netaddr is an IPv4-mapped IPv6
	address, rather than using AF_INET6 as was done previously.  The
	subsequent memcmps need to be adjusted accordingly.  This should
	hopefully resolve Bug#2204.

2003-10-11 10:01  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	The BSDs are not the only systems that might provide
	gethostbyname2().  It seems that some Linux kernels have been

	Removing the pr_netaddr_get_fqdn() function.  It was only being
	used in one place: to set the main_server->ServerFQDN member. 
	ServerFQDN is used in the logging prefix, and for vhosts, was
	usually the IP address.  With this change, the log prefix for
	entries generated by vhosts will be their DNS names (if possible). 
	It also removes a call to gethostbyname() which on *BSDs might not
	have performed as expected for IPv6 strings.

	server would be used, instead of the true DefaultServer.  For both
	inetd- and standalone-run proftpds, if no exactly matching vhost
	was found for a client, the localhost server (i.e. the "server

	Bug#2167 - getnameinfo() on FreeBSD doesn't support IP address
	lookups.
	
	FreeBSD's struct sockaddr_in and struct sockaddr_in6 have the
	sin_len and sin6_len members.  The code in pr_netaddr_get_addr()
	was not properly initializing these members, and so when those
	structs were given to getnameinfo(), getnameinfo() didn't handle
	them well.  Solaris and Linux don't have these _len members, so the
	problem didn't crop up there.
	
	IPv6 systems whose structs have these _len members are supposed to
	define the SIN6_LEN symbol, by RFC design.  However, it's possible
	that a system not support IPv6 and yet have the sin_len member and
	the getnameinfo() function.  So rather than just rely on SIN6_LEN
	being present, I added an autoconf check for the sin_len member,
	and an IPv4 SIN_LEN symbol.

2003-09-07 17:36  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Use memcpy() rather than memmove(), as memcpy() is a little more

	* NEWS, include/bindings.h, src/bindings.c: 
	Bug#2146 - DNS names not handled properly when --enable-ipv6 is
	used.  As mentioned in the report, this was caused by a design
	assumption revealed by the addition of IPv6 support: that of a
	one-to-one association between a server_rec and its listening
	connection.  For DNS names resolving to A and AAAA records, there
	can be two listening connections for a given server_rec.  The fix
	occurs in the Bindings API, where a server_rec's listeners are now
	associated with the bindings for the server_rec, rather than with
	the server_rec itself.	Multiple bindings can point to the same
	server_rec.

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	Fixed mod_ifsession's handling of multiple configuration sets.	The
	problem was that mod_ifsession, after merging in the configuration
	from a config_rec, would call xaset_remove() and remove that
	config_rec from the main server's configuration sets.  This had the
	side effect of making other config_recs in the set, in the set
	after the removed config_rec, no longer visible by the iterating
	function.  As in Perl: don't change the items in a list while
	iterating over it.  Instead, queue up the changes you want to make
	while iterating, wait until finished iterating, and then change the
	list.

	This variable expands to the arguments given in an FTP command. 
	Currently, there is %m for just the command, %r for the full

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	Changed handling of RNTO slightly.  It would clear session.xfer.p
	at the end of the CMD phase.  Unfortunately, this meant that for
	ExtendedLog/SQLLog, which might want to use %f for RNTO, the path
	allocated from that pool would be gone.  Now, a LOG_CMD/LOG_CMD_ERR
	handler for RNTO does the clearing of session.xfer.p for RNTO, thus
	letting mod_log/mod_sql have a chance to do their stuff.

	Bug#2009: ncurses/ftptop linker problem on Solaris.  The system in

	script used libncurses when linking ftptop (as ncurses is preferred
	if we can get it) without checking to see if ncurses.h was present.
	 Now, the library is checked only if the corresponding header is
	present.

	Bug#2011 - No "FTP session closed." msgs written to logfile.  The
	check for when to write the message ("!is_master") only checks if
	the current process is a child process, not an existing daemon
	process.  This works well for standalone daemons, but not inetd-run
	daemons, which have no "master" process.  The fix, then, is to log
	the message if either !is_master or if the servertype is inetd.

	* src/scoreboard.c: 
	Be a little more careful about interrupted system calls.  In some

	In others, we simply block all signals that might interrupt the

	Note: we'll need to document, probably in the release announcement,
	when the scoreboard format (include/scoreboard.h's
	PR_SCOREBOARD_VERSION) is increment.  For standalone-run daemons,
	there is no problem; for inetd-run daemons, though, the old
	scoreboard file will need to be deleted before the new daemon is
	started, else the new daemon will complain of the scoreboard being
	too old.  (I think this is what we are seeing now with people
	upgrading from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8; it's the first time in who knows how
	long that the scoreboard version number was increment.)

	* NEWS: 
	Should mention mod_radius changes here.

2003-03-20 22:44  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Changing way mod_radius looks up custom attributes in response
	packets; now, rather than using RADIUS attribute type IDs,
	mod_radius will use VSA IDs.  The new RadiusVendor directive is
	used to configure the vendor for which mod_radius will search.	The
	new RadiusGroupInfo complements the existing RadiusUserInfo
	directive; as expected, RadiusGroupInfo is used to configure RADIUS
	user group membership information.

	Making the checking of the configuration file path actually work.
	
	Getting rid of #PR_HACK_DISABLE_MEM_VHOST_FREE, and commenting out
	the freeing code completely.  Copy-on-write semantics means that
	that freeing of memory, which would not be used or changed anyway,

	* include/fsio.h, modules/mod_core.c, src/fsio.c, src/main.c: 
	Modifying the checking of configuration paths slightly.  Rather
	than now only accepting absolute paths (criterion: string begins
	with '/'), paths that start with any of the paths registered with
	the FSIO layer will be accepted.  This allows FSIO modules to
	register handlers for paths that may not necessarily be local
	filesystem paths (e.g. "sql://" paths).  This change affects the

	Adding yet another module callback registration set of functions. 
	This set is for allowing modules to register callbacks that are
	invoked just before the daemon starts up, after it has (possibly)
	daemonized.  One would want to have something done at this point
	when you want to make sure that the daemon process is affected,
	e.g. adding a timer.  Calling alarm(3) in a module_init function
	won't work for standalone daemons, for part of the daemonizing
	process involves forking() twice (to dissociate the process
	completely from the terminal), and all pending alarms are cleared
	for a child process.

	This patch prevents two specific vhost misconfigurations: 1) trying
	to use "0.0.0.0", which no client could ever reach, and 2) IP
	address/port collisions.  The second is the more likely of the
	misconfigurations, particularly when DNS names, rather than IP

	Note that a manual #define had to be used, to ensure backward

	Formalizing the use of "hooks", which are custom cmdtable entries
	that contrib modules can add.  mod_sql started the trend with its
	"sql_lookup" and "sql_change" hooks.  This patch makes sure that
	any such hooks will not be accidentally used; it was possible, if a
	custom hook was entered that has an all uppercase name, for a
	client to send an FTP command that matched that name, leading to a
	possible bad interaction.
	
	This patch avoids the above scenario by defining a new symbol tag,
	PR_SYM_HOOK, to be used for "hook" cmdtable entries.  I'll add
	documentation about this in the Developer's Guide as appropriate.

	Actually check for a negative return value from the module

	* src/data.c: 
	Fixing the timing of setting of socket options.  The
	tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives were
	not taking effect properly because setsockopt(2) was being called,
	for the data connection, _after_ the TCP handshake was done.  As it
	is during the handshake when such things as window sizes are
	negotiated, this timing rendered any configuration settings
	useless.

2003-01-13 10:25  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	As John pointed out, it's better to have run-time generated files,
	much like coredumps, to be under RUN_DIR (/var/run/proftpd), or
	CORE_DIR (although CORE_DIR is #defined to be RUN_DIR).  So now,
	the profiling gmon.out and bb.out files will be found there, rather
	than /tmp.
	
	Thanks, John! =)

2003-01-12 21:38  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, modules/mod_core.c, src/main.c: 
	Added DEVEL_NO_DAEMON define, and changed other DEBUG_* defines to
	match.	The purpose for these is to be able to build a proftpd
	daemon that can be profiled.  Now, one can have a configure
	statement such as:
	
	  CFLAGS="-DDEVEL_NO_DAEMON -DDEVEL_NO_FORK -g -pg -a" \
	    LIBS="-pg" ./configure ...
	
	The resulting daemon will only handle one session.  The bb.out and
	gmon.out profiling files will be written to /tmp.

	The distinction for which I am striving is to have all the
	functions that module developers should use to be prefixed with
	pr_; public functions may be available without a pr_ prefix, but
	such functions will be intended for use by the core code only.
	
	Also, more in the RFC2228 support department:
	
	  session_t has a new field, rfc2228_mech.  This is to be filled in
	by
	  the RFC2228 module that handles an AUTH command, so that other
	  RFC2228 modules, should they be higher in the module load order,
	know
	  not to process RFC2228 commands meant for the handling module.
	
	  The response formatting callback function now takes an additional
	  parameter, a pool pointer, as the first argument.  The pool that
	will
	  be passed to that function will be the same pool used by the
	other
	  response functions.

	  </Directory>
	
	or
	
	  <Global>
	  </Global>
	
	appear in the configuration file.  These empty sets are useless,
	and serve only to use up memory unnecessarily; that memory usage is
	compounded when directives are merged down into these sets.

	and removes them from the configuration tree.

2002-12-16 11:07  castaglia

	* include/modules.h: 
	Returning ERROR from an auth handler (specifically, in an "auth" or
	a "check" auth handler) will not produce the desired result; the
	ERROR macro sets a value of 1, and the switch() case in mod_auth
	looks for negative values.  So, to handle this case, I've added
	PR_AUTH_ERROR return value (-1) for auth handlers that encounter
	errors, and adjusted the other PR_AUTH_* values accordingly.

2002-12-16 10:45  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/main.c: 
	Make the function for dispatching commands a public function:
	pr_cmd_dispatch().  Some RFC2228 modules may need to "unwrap"

	themselves.  (This also allows for greater games to be played by
	third-party modules...muahahaha...) *grin*

	* include/options.h, lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	These changes make it possible to tune the maximum number of
	recursion levels supported when globbing.  A better way of dealing
	with possible DoS attacks via globbing is via the RLimit*
	directives, or to disable globbing support altogether by using the
	UseGlobbing directive.	However, in some cases it may be necessary
	to support globbing, but to do so in as restrictive a manner as
	possible.
	
	The default maximum number of levels supported by GNU's globbing is
	8.  This patch keeps that default, but allows the administrator, if
	need be, to tune that level lower by means of the
	PR_TUNABLE_GLOBBING_MAX macro, defined in include/options.h.  When
	compiling proftpd, it can be defined to some lower value, e.g.:

	* modules/mod_ls.c, src/main.c: 
	Added signal processing for recursive directory listings Added
	masking of SIGCHLD in the SIGCHLD processing function Added debug
	logging, at level 7, of module session initialization callbacks

	/var/log directory, which shows up in the logs as "unable to stat()
	/var/log" -- not indicative of the culprit [TransferLog]).

	* src/: dirtree.c, main.c, support.c: 
	Fixed minor HUP memory leak, caused by use of schedule() to
	schedule an invocation of main_rehash().  A sched_t object is
	allocated for the scheduling from permanent_pool, but that object
	is never freed.  The fix was to add a pool member to the sched_t
	struct, allocated a subpool from permanent_pool, allocate the
	sched_t struct from that subpool, and assign the subpool to the
	struct's pool member.  That way, the sched_t object can be
	destroyed once the scheduled callback has been invoked.  Also
	cleaned up some of the main_rehash() code, to make it more legible.

	This fixes a border case where using 0 as the value for
	SQLDefault{UID,GID} or SQLMinUser{ID,UID,GID} would cause that

	_LARGE_FILES), and so this additional check (which assumes that if
	the size of an unsigned long long is 8 bytes, the underlying
	platform will support use of %llu -- and we all know what happens
	when one assumes) is required for proper LFS detection and support
	on FreeBSD (and perhaps other platforms?).

2002-05-12 22:15  castaglia

	* configure.in: 
	
	TJ: being pedantic, changing the order of functions check to be
	alphabetical.	   Also, I need to check configure.in separately
	from, and before, configure.	  This is so that when users
	download from CVS, and run ./configure && make,      the make
	program's check of the timestamp on configure.in shows an     
	earlier date on configure.in than on configure (if both
	configure.in and      configure are checked into CVS
	simultaneously, they will have the same      timestamps, and make
	will cause the configure script to be run again).      What a pain.
