Using ProFTPD with UnixWare 7.1

UnixWare 7.x has an odd problem involving tcp sockets inside of a
chroot()  [as used w/ DefaultRoot and Anonymous logins].  Apparently, due
to the UnixWare xti code, socket operations initially attempt to open a few
devices, including /dev/tcp, /dev/udp, /dev/zero and /dev/ticotsord.  This
is most likely caused by the networking libraries, and is completely out
of the control and/or scope of ProFTPD.

UnixWare 7.1 users wishing to use ProFTP will have to do something like
the following in their anonymous or otherwise chroot'ed directories:

[ !!NOTE!!  Do not use the major/minor device numbers below verbatim.
  Solaris on different archs will use different major/minors.  Check
  your OS documentation first before doing this. ]

mkdir dev
mknod dev/tcp c 7 37
mknod dev/zero c 39 1

# the following is necessary to allow proftpd to create a socket
# when in non-low-port mode (such as during passive transfers)
chmod 0666 dev/tcp

Failure to create these files will result in "socket() failed in
inet_create_connection(): No such file or directory" when a user logs in
anonymously and attempts to transfer data of any type (including a simple
directory listing).

If you receive errors such as "socket() failed in
inet_create_connection(): Permission denied", you need to chmod 0666 your
dev/tcp device. 

Additionally you will need to create the file etc/netconfig or you'll
get the following error message: _s_match: setnetconfig failed

mkdir etc
cp /etc/netconfig etc/netconfig
