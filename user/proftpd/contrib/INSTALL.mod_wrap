To install mod_wrap, copy the mod_wrap.c file into

  <proftpd-dir>/contrib

after unpacking the proftpd-1.2.5rc1 (or later) source code.  Then run:

  ./configure --with-modules=mod_wrap
  make
  make install

Solaris system users will need to obtain and build the tcpwrappers library, as
it does not come installed by default with Solaris.

mod_wrap-1.2.2 and later will not build properly on FreeBSD-4.4, as they, in
their wisdom, decided to put the NIS/YP functions in a library other than
libnsl.a (which is where Solaris and Linux have those functions).  This means
that, when building proftpd with mod_wrap-1.2.2 (or later) on FreeBSD-4.4
(possibly earlier?) platforms will need to change this line in mod_wrap.c:

 * $Libraries: -lwrap -lnsl$

to be:

 * $Libraries: -lwrap$
