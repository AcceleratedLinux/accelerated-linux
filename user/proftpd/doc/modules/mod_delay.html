<h2><b>ProFTPD module <code>mod_delay</code></b></h2>

<p>
The <code>mod_delay</code> module is designed to make a certain type of
information leak, known as a &quot;timing attack&quot;, harder.

<p>
When <code>proftpd</code> processes the <code>USER</code> and <code>PASS</code>
FTP commands from a client, it has to perform checks against configured
ACLs, look up user and group information, etc.  These checks are not done
if the given username is known to not exist for the server, in order to
not tie up system resources needlessly.  However, this does mean that more
work is done when handling &quot;good&quot; users than when handling
&quot;bad&quot; users.  This difference can be detected in the time it takes
for <code>proftpd</code> to send a response to the <code>USER</code> and
<code>PASS</code> commands.  This means it is possible for an attacker
to look for these statistical timing differences, and determine which
users are &quot;good&quot; and which are &quot;bad&quot;.  From there,
a determined attacker can focus their attention on the known good usernames.
Note that the timings will vary depending on server load, number of
users in the user base, type of storage of user data (<i>e.g.</i>
LDAP directories, SQL tables, RADIUS servers, flat files, <i>etc</i>).

<p>
The <code>mod_delay</code> module attempts to prevent such timing differences
by keeping track of the time taken to process the <code>USER</code> and
<code>PASS</code> commands.  It does this for the most recent
<code>USER</code> and <code>PASS</code> commands.  The timing data are
stored in the module's <code>DelayTable</code>.  If the module detects
that <code>proftpd</code> has not taken enough time to handle one of these
commands, compared to its past response times, a small delay will be added
to the response cycle.  The amount of delay is determined by the difference
between the current time spent handling the command and the median time
spent handling the same command in the past.

<p>
The most current version of <code>mod_dso</code> can be found in the
ProFTPD source distribution:

of the module as it was developed.

<h2>Directives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#DelayEngine">DelayEngine</a>
  <li><a href="#DelayTable">DelayTable</a>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="DelayEngine">DelayEngine</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> DelayEngine <em>on|off</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> DelayEngine on<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> &quot;server config&quot;<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_delay<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.10rc1 and later

<p>
The <code>DelayEngine</code> directive enables or disables the module's
runtime delaying calculations.  If it is set to <em>off</em> this module
does no delaying.  Use this directive to disable the module.

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_delay.c&gt;
    DelayEngine off
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<h2><a name="DelayTable">DelayTable</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> DelayTable <em>path</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> DelayTable var/proftpd/proftpd.delay<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> &quot;server config&quot;<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_delay<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.10rc1 and later

<p>
The <code>DelayTable</code> directive configures a <em>path</em> to a file
that <code>mod_delay</code> uses for storing its timing data.  The given
<em>path</em> must be an absolute path.  It is recommended that this file
<b>not</b> be on an NFS mounted partition.

<p>
Note that timing data is kept across daemon stop/starts.  When new
<code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>s are added to the configuration, though,
<code>mod_delay</code> will detect that it does not have a suitable
<code>DelayTable</code> for the new configuration, and will clear all
stored data.

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
The <code>mod_delay</code> module is compiled by default.
