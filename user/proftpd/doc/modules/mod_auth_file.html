<h2><b>ProFTPD module <code>mod_auth_file</code></b></h2>
</center>
<hr><br>

This module is contained in the <code>mod_auth_file.c</code> file for
ProFTPD 1.2, and is compiled by default.

<h2>Directives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#AuthGroupFile">AuthGroupFile</a>
  <li><a href="#AuthUserFile">AuthUserFile</a>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="AuthGroupFile"></a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthGroupFile <em>path [id min-max] [name regex]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_file<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.7rc2

<p>
The <code>AuthGroupFile</code> configures an alternate group file for providing
group membership information; the specified file must have the same format as
the system <code>/etc/group</code> file, and if specified is used during
authentication and group lookups for directory/access control operations. The
<em>path</em> argument should be the full path to the specified file. This
directive can be configured on a per-server basis, so that virtual FTP servers
can each have their own authentication file, often in conjunction with an
<a href="#AuthUserFile"><code>AuthUserFile</code></a>.

<p>
Note that this file does <i>not</i> need to reside inside a
<code>chroot()</code>ed directory structure for anonymous or
<code>DefaultRoot</code> logins, as it is held open for the duration of a
session.

<p>
The optional parameters are used to set restrictions on the contents of
the specified file.  The <em>id</em> restriction is used to specify a range
of GIDs that may appear in the file; when doing a lookup, if a group entry
has a GID that is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum is
encountered, that entry is ignored.  The <em>name</em> restriction is used
to specify a regular expression that is applied to the name of a group
entry.  If the group name does not match the regular expression, the group
entry is ignored.  A leading <code>!</code> in the regular expression can
be used to negate the given expression.

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  # This makes an AuthGroupFile that can only have GIDs 2000 to 4000, and
  # whose groups must start with 'cust'
  AuthGroupFile /etc/ftpd/group id 2000-4000 name ^cust
</pre>

<h2><a name="AuthUserFile"></a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthUserFile <em>path [id min-max] [home regex] [name regex]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_file<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.7rc2

<p>
The <code>AuthUserFile</code> configures an alternate passwd file for providing
user account information; the specified file must have the same format as the
system <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, and if specified is used during
authentication and user lookups for directory/access control operations. The
<em>path</em> argument should be the full path to the specified file. This
directive can be configured on a per-server basis, so that virtual FTP servers
can each have their own authentication file, often in conjunction with an
<a href="#AuthGroupFile"><code>AuthGroupFile</code></a>.

<p>
Note that this file does <i>not</i> need to reside inside a
<code>chroot()</code>ed directory structure for anonymous or
<code>DefaultRoot</code> logins, as it is held open for the duration of a
session.

<p>
The optional parameters are used to set restrictions on the contents of
the specified file.  The <em>id</em> restriction is used to specify a range
of UIDs that may appear in the file; when doing a lookup, if a user entry
has a UID that is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum is
encountered, that entry is ignored.  The <em>home</em> restriction is used
to specify a regular expression that is applied to the home directory of a user
entry.  If the home does not match the regular expression, the user entry
is ignored.  The <em>name</em> restriction is used to specify a regular
expression that is applied to the name of a user entry.  If the user name does
not match the regular expression, the user entry is ignored.  A leading
<code>!</code> in these regular expressions can be used to negate the given
expression.

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  # This makes an AuthUserFile whose user names must start with 'ftp', and
  # whose homes cannot start with /home.
  AuthUserFile /etc/ftpd/passwd name ^ftp home !^/home
</pre>
