<hr>

<p>
Use of the <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> configuration directive is, in
general, straightforward.  However, there are a few caveats of which to
be aware.

<p>
First, it is not necessary to nest <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>; the
daemon will not let one do this, in fact.  The daemon will determine
automatically the relations of <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> paths,
depending on the path given and surrounding configuration context.

<p>
Always use the normal, absolute path for a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>
section, regardless of whether that directory will eventually be accessed
during a session which has been <code>chroot</code>'d, as for
<code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> or <code>DefaultRoot</code>ed sessions.
There are two allowed exceptions to the rule of using absolute paths:
if the path has a <code>~</code> prefix, or if the
<code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> occurs within a <code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code>
section.  In the latter case, the path may be relative (<i>i.e.</i> does
not need to start with a <code>/</code>), in which case the path will be
relative to the directory to which anonymous sessions are restricted.

<p>
If the name of the directory contains spaces, you should enclose the entire
directory name in quotations, <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory &quot;/path/to/My Directory&quot;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
As noted in the documentation, use of a <code>/*</code> suffix on a path
will change the effect of a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> section
slightly.  For example:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /path/to/dir&gt;
</pre>
applies the section's configuration directives to the <code>dir</code>
directory and its contents, while:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /path/to/dir/*&gt;
</pre>
applies the section's configuration directives only to the <i>contents</i>
of <code>dir</code>, not to the directory itself.  This is a small
distinction, but it can often cause misconfigurations.  In general, unless
you know what you're doing, it's best not to use a <code>/*</code> suffix.

<p>
Also, a <code>*</code> within a path, such as:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /path/to/*/dir&gt; 
</pre>
will only match that single directory level, and will not match multiple
directory levels.  This means that the above <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>
will match:
<pre>
  /path/to/<b>a/</b>dir
  /path/to/<b>b/</b>dir
</pre>
because <code>*</code> will match the <code>a/</code> and <code>b/</code>,
as they are on the same level in the path as <code>*</code>.  However, the
following paths <b>will not</b> match:
<pre>
  /path/to/<b>some/other/</b>dir
  /path/to/<b>some/other/level/</b>dir
</pre>
since <code>*</code> does not expand to <code>some/other/</code> or
<code>/some/other/level/</code>; they cover multiple levels.

<p>
There is another case about which the administrator should know: for the
purposes of handling the <code>APPE</code>, <code>RETR</code>,
<code>STOR</code>, and <code>STOU</code> FTP commands, the daemon will
match a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> path with the filename appended. As
above, in most cases this will not matter much.  However, consider the case
where the administrator specifically wants to use the trailing <code>/*</code>,
as when she wants a particular <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> to apply to all
subdirectories of a given directory, but not to that directory itself.  For
example, the administrators wishes to block anonymous uploads everywhere
except for subdirectories of <code>upload/</code>:
<pre>
  &lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;
    User ftp
    Group ftp

    UserAlias anonymous ftp

    &lt;Limit WRITE&gt;
      DenyAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;

    &lt;Directory upload/*&gt;
      &lt;Limit STOR&gt;
        AllowAll
      &lt;/Limit&gt;
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
  &lt;/Anonymous&gt;
</pre>
This configuration <i>looks</i> like it should work, allowing files to be
uploaded only to subdirectories of <code>upload/</code>, but not to the
<code>upload/</code> directory itself.  As described above, though, the
daemon will append the filename being uploaded via <code>STOR</code> to the
path used when looking up <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, meaning that
<code>upload/<i>filename</i></code> will match <code>upload/*</code>, and
allow files to be uploaded into <code>upload/</code>.  In this particular case,
then, what is wanted is to use this <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> pattern:
<pre>
    &lt;Directory upload/*/*&gt;
      &lt;Limit STOR&gt;
        AllowAll
      &lt;/Limit&gt;
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
which will achieve the desired effect of allowing uploads only in
subdirectories of the given directory, <code>upload/</code>.

<p>
Also, it is good to keep in mind the <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/doc/devel-guide/internals/ftpaccess.html">similarity</a> between a
<code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> section and a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file.
In some cases, using <code>.ftpaccess</code> files might be more convenient.
The <code>AllowOverride</code> configuration directive (which first appeared
in the 1.2.7rc1 release) will provide fine-grained control over when
<code>.ftpaccess</code> files will be honored.
