<p>
Users of ProFTPD will often encounters problems.  It happens with all software,
not just ProFTPD.  How, then, does the user track down the cause of the
problem, and fix it?  This is the art of debugging.  When users post these
problems are the mailing lists, it is extremely helpful to include the
following bits of information to help find the answer.  Even better is when the
user follows these steps and determines the solution for themselves.

<p>
<b>Know the Version</b><br>
Various problems afflict various versions of the code, so when tracking down
problems, it is good to know the version being used:
<pre>
  proftpd -vv
</pre>
It is possible that the problem you are encountering is due to some bug
that may already be fixed in a more current version, fixed in the CVS
repository, or has a bug report with an attached patch.  Searching
<a href="http://bugs.proftpd.org">http://bugs.proftpd.org</a> will often
yield useful information, depending on the keywords used in the search.

<p>
<b>Know the Modules</b><br>
System administrators who compile and install the server from the souce
code distribution will probably already know this, but administrators who
install using RPMs or other package formats may not know the specifics of
the contained pre-built binary.  To list the modules compiled into the
server:
<pre>
  proftpd -l
</pre>
Knowing the modules helps to pinpoint the source of error messages (<i>e.g.</i>
<code>mod_tls</code> and certificate files).

<p>
<b>Perform Configuration Check</b><br>
When making changes to the configuration file, it is often helpful to make sure
that your changes are valid.  The easiest way to do this is to do an
informative syntax check:
<pre>
  proftpd -td5
</pre>
The <code>-t</code> option directs the server to only do a syntax check, to
parse the configuration file but stop before actually starting its operations
as a server.  The <code>-d5</code> will cause the server to display debugging
messages during this testing of the configuration file.  Another useful
command is:
<pre>
  proftpd -c <i>/path/to/new/config/file</i> -td5
</pre>
which lets you test the syntax of some new configuration file before it
is put into production.

If you are still having problems, and you have verified that your
<code>proftpd.conf</code> is correct, the next step is see what debugging
messages are generated during an FTP session, as described next.

<p>
<b>Collect Debug Information</b><br>
<code>proftpd</code> has built-in debug information reporting capabilities -
the trick is in enabling that reporting, and tracking down where it is sent.
The easiest way to get the debugging information is to start the server from
the command line using:
<pre>
  proftpd -nd6
</pre>
<b>Note</b>: make sure that no other <code>proftpd</code> instances are
running before using this command, otherwise you will see:
<pre>
  Failed binding to 0.0.0.0, port 21: Address already in use
</pre>
This message means that some other program is already bound to the socket
at that address/port.  This message will also appear if you attempt the
debugging command with a <code>ServerType</code> of <code>inetd</code>; this
is described below.

<p>
Once working, the above debugging command will display lots of information on
the connected terminal's screen, both as the server starts up and during the
servicing of any clients.  If clients are having trouble logging in or
authenticating, the debug messages reported by the server when a client
connects are much more useful than knowing the messages displayed by the
client, as the client does not know <i>why</i> it cannot log in.  If asked to
send debugging information to the mailing list, you can send the relevant
snippets (if you know what the relevant debug messages are), or you can
capture the debug output to a file:
<pre>
  proftpd -nd5 2>&1 >& /path/to/debug/file
</pre>
and send that file, compressed, along with your post.

<p>
The above method works if you have <code>ServerType standalone</code> in your
configuration file.   If you run the server in <code>inetd</code> mode instead,
and are unable or unwilling to make the changes necessary to run the server
in <code>standalone</code> mode for the sake of debugging, then use of the
<code>SystemLog</code> configuration directive is necessary for capturing the
debug information.  Add this directive to your configuration file, and add
<code>-d5</code> to your <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>'s <code>ftp</code> line,
or to the <code>server_args</code> tag in your <code>xinetd</code>
configuration file for the server.  Be sure to restart
<code>inetd/xinetd</code> so that your configuration changes will take effect.

<p>
Note that use of the <code>SystemLog</code> directive is not necessarily
confined to <code>inetd</code> mode servers.  If you are interested in letting
your <code>standalone</code> server run unattended and want to have that
debugging information in the log file, use <code>SystemLog</code> and
add <code>-d5</code> (or whatever your preferred debug level is) to the
server startup script.

<p>
As of version 1.2.8rc1, ProFTPD supports a <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_DebugLevel.html"><code>DebugLevel</code></a>
configuration directive.  This lets you set a debugging level in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code> file, without needing to edit <code>inetd.conf</code>
or <code>xinetd</code> configuration file.

<p>
<b>Locate Log Files</b><br>
A common response on the mailing lists to a posted question is: &quot;What
do your server logs say?&quot;  Locating the server's log files can be
troublesome, depending on your configuration.  If the
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_SystemLog.html"><code>SystemLog</code></a> configuration directive is in effect, you know exactly where
the server's log file is.  If not, then by default the server uses
<code>syslog</code> for logging.  The location of <code>syslog</code>'d log
files is set in your system's <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> file.  You may
need to read your system's man pages for <code>syslog.conf</code> or
<code>syslogd</code> to understand the format of that file.  Note that the
server will log using a <code>syslog</code> facility of <code>daemon</code>
(and level <code>debug</code> when debugging) for most of its messages; during
authentication, messages are logged using the <code>authpriv</code> facility.

<p>
<b>Common Problems</b><br>
One common question is: &quot;I changed the configuration file, but the new
configuration is not being seen!&quot; The solution depends on your
configured
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_ServerType.html"><code>ServerType</code></a>.  Almost certainly it will be <code>standalone</code>, as
<code>inetd</code>-mode servers pick up configuration changes almost instantly
(the server is started from the ground up for each connection).  For
configuration changes to be seen by a <code>standalone</code> server, you need
to either stop, then start the server (the hard way), or to send the
<code>HUP</code> signal the the daemon process.

<p>
Another common question involves use of ProFTPD's <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>
directive to restrict certain FTP commands.  These limits always function
<b>in addition to</b> the normal filesystem permissions, <b>not</b> instead
of them.  If having problems writing, deleting, or updating files, check
your directory and file permissions first.

<p>
Once you have the debug output and various other information, and are still
in need of help, search the FAQ, Userguide, and mailing list archives for
material related to the problem.  If you're unable to find anything helpful
in these sources, post your question to the appropriate mailing list.  Be
sure to include the version used, your <code>proftpd.conf</code>, and possibly
any debug information.
