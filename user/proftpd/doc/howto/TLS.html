<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>

<p><a name="TLSCertificates">
<font color=red>Question</font>: How do I generate the certificate files used
by <code>mod_tls</code>?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The <code>mod_tls</code> module uses the
same certificate files as Apache's <code>mod_ssl</code>.  The
<code>mod_ssl</code> documentation explains what the files are, how they
are used, and how to generate your own:

<p><a name="TLSClients">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Where can I find a list of clients that
support FTPS?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: This page is a good FTPS resource:
<pre>
  <a href="http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html">http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html</a>
</pre>
including the list of FTPS <a href="http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html#client">clients</a>.  On a related note, there have been some
reports that Debian's <code>ftp-ssl</code> client has a few bugs; using Peter
Runestig's <code>ftp-tls</code> is known to work.

<p>
Note, though, that there are known issues with some FTPS clients:

<p><a name="TLSImplicit">
<font color=red>Question</font>: How come <code>mod_tls</code> does not support
&quot;implicit&quot; FTPS (<i>i.e.</i> automatically encrypting sessions on
port 990)?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The short answer is because the Draft no longer
specifies support for such a mode.  Here is a <a href="http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html#bad">description</a> of why the alternatives
to the current mode (client-requested encryption using standard control
channel) are &quot;bad&quot;.

<p>
The long answer is covered in Eric Rescorla's excellent book, <a href="http://www.rtfm.com/sslbook/">&quot;SSL and TLS&quot;</a>.  There tend to be two
different strategies used when adding new features to a protocol: separate
ports for protocol variants, or upward negotiation.  Port 443 for HTTPS is an
example of the separate ports strategy.  The drawback to the separate ports
approach is that there is a finite number of ports available, and so this
approach does not scale well.  The benefit is that use of separate ports tends
to require smaller changes to client and server code.  Upward negotiation
is more flexible, but requires that the protocol support some sort of feature
negotiation or extension discovery, allowing clients and servers to easily
agree to negotiate &quot;upward&quot; into a secure channel.  The authors
of the FTPS Draft felt that upward negotiation was the more appropriate of
these two approaches for encrypting FTP channels.

<p><a name="TLSPerUser">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Can I require TLS on a per-user basis?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Prior to ProFTPD 1.2.10rc2, no.  The IETF
Draft specifying FTP over TLS requires that the TLS handshake occur
<i>before</i> the client sends the <code>USER</code> command.  This means that
the server does not know the name of the user that the client will be using
when the TLS session is established.  It is possible that the client's
certificate, if one is even presented, may contain information the server may
use to map that certificate to a user, but such mapping is not currently
supported by <code>mod_tls</code>.  Note that this is also the reason the
<code>TLSRequired</code> directive cannot appear in the
<code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> context: anonymous logins are based on the
<code>USER</code> command.

<p>
However, in 1.2.10rc2, the <code>mod_tls</code> module was modified to allow
such per-user TLS requirements.  To do this, the <code>AllowPerUser</code>
parameter of the <code>TLSOptions</code> directive is used.  For example,
the following example <code>mod_tls</code> configuration allows non-SSL
anonymous sessions, but requires SSL/TLS for all other sessions:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_tls.c&gt;
    TLSEngine on
    TLSRSACertificateFile ...
    TLSCACertificateFile ...
    TLSOptions AllowPerUser
    TLSRequired on

    &lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;
      User ftp
      Group ftp
      UserAlias anonymous ftp

      RequireValidShell off

      # Note how TLSRequired is set to off here in the &lt;Anonymous&gt; context
      TLSRequired off
    &lt;/Anonymous&gt;
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
The modification also allows <code>mod_ifsession</code>-based conditions, so
that one can have settings like:
<pre>
  &lt;IfGroup trusted&gt;
    TLSRequired off
  &lt;/IfGroup&gt;
</pre>
However, there is a risk involved in using the <code>AllowPerUser</code>
option: it causes <code>mod_tls</code> not to enforce <code>TLSRequired</code>
until <i>after</i> the potentially sensitive USER and PASS commands have
been sent by the client.  This allows clients, even when
<code>TLSRequired on</code> or <code>TLSRequired ctrl</code> are in effect,
to send the USER and PASS commands <i>unencrypted</i>.  Depending on your
site's security needs, the ability to require SSL/TLS on a per-user basis
may or may not be worth the ability to require SSL/TLS for the USER and PASS
commands.

<p><a name="TLSFXP">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why does <code>mod_tls</code> break FXP
transfers?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The Draft specifying FTP over SSL explicitly
omits site-to-site transfers.  A TLS session is established between the client
and the server on the control channel and, to save on the expensive overhead of
TLS handshake, that session is reused for encrypting traffic on the data
channel.  In a site-to-site transfer, the client opens <i>two</i> control
channels, one with each server, and then arranges for those servers to open a
data channel between themselves.  However, since the servers have not
established a TLS session between themselves, that opening of the data channel
fails.

<p>
Note that the above happens only if the server requires that TLS be used on data
connections (<i>e.g.</i> <code>TLSRequired</code> is either <em>on</em> or
<em>data</em>), of if the client tells the server that the client will be
using TLS on the data connections (<i>e.g.</i> when it sends the
<code>AUTH</code> command with an argument of <code>TLS-P</code>).  Without
these conditions, site-to-site transfers can occur normally, albeit unencrypted.
Encrypted site-to-site transfers are not supported.

<p><a name="TLSv2">
<font color=red>Question</font>: How come <code>mod_tls</code> does not support
SSLv2?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Various defects have been found in the SSLv2
protocol.  Some legacy sites need to support SSLv2 for their HTTP traffic, in
spite of its flaws.  Use of FTP over TLS is fairly new, however, and there is
not much &quot;legacy&quot; in that regard; it was felt that, as
<code>mod_tls</code> aims to provide strong cryptographic security, supporting
a known bad protocol is a Bad Idea.

<p><a name="TLSFirewall">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Using <code>mod_tls</code>, FTP sessions
through my firewall now no longer work.  What's going on?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The short answer is that FTPS and firewalls
(and devices performing NAT) do not interact well.  The control connection
happens on a well-known port, and has no issues; it is the data connection
that poses problems for FTP-aware firewalls.  In a non-FTPS session, the
firewall can inspect the FTP server's responses on the control connection to a
client's <code>PASV</code> or <code>PORT</code> command, and thus know which
on which ports/addresses the data connection will be established.  In an FTPS
session, though, those control connection messages are encrypted (that is the
point of using FTPS, right?), and so the FTP-aware firewall cannot peek.
Hence, it cannot know which on which ports the data connection will be
established.  For firewalls that are configured to always allow a certain
range of ports (such as might be configured using the <code>PassivePorts</code>
directive), FTPS should function without issue.

<p>
Unfortunately, this is a rather intractable--and known--issue.  Earlier
versions of the Draft defining FTPS used to allow something known as
&quot;implicit&quot; FTPS, by which a client could contact a well-known port
(akin to port 443 for HTTPS; FTPS used port 990) and the server, simply
because the client contacted that certain port, would automatically encrypt
the session.  This approach has several drawbacks (the reason why it was
removed from later versions of the Draft), but it <i>did</i> allow for simple
TCP proxying.  There has been no replacement.

<p><a name="TLSSlow">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Sometimes my encrypted transfers are slow.
Is there a way to speed them up?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>:  There have been reports that increasing the
tunable buffer size (using the <code>--enable-buffer-size</code> option
of the <code>configure</code> script) to 8192 increases transfer speeds, most
notably on very high speed networks.  Increasing the buffer size does not
appear to affect normal FTP transfers (in fact, it may benefit them as well,
depending on the client).

<p><a name="TLSDataProtection">
<font color=red>Question</font>: I can login using FTPS, but I cannot see
any directories.  Why not?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: You have most likely configured
<code>mod_tls</code> to require SSL/TLS protection for data transfers as
well as control commands, by using:
<pre>
  TLSRequired on
</pre>
However, if your FTPS client does not expect to handle encrypted data
transfers (and directory listings count as data transfers, as they are
sent over a data channel), you may see your client appear to hang, waiting
for data it can read.  Make sure your client is prepared to handle the
security requirements you have configured on the server.

<p>
You may also see the following appear in the <code>TLSLog</code> on occasion:
<pre>
  PROT: unwilling to accept security parameter (C), declining
</pre>
The <code>PROT</code> FTP command is used to set the protection level to
be used for data transfers.  Some clients send a <code>PROT</code> command
with a security parameter of <code>C</code>, meaning &quot;Clear&quot;,
which effectively tells the server not to protect data transfers.  The
<code>mod_tls</code> module will refuse the <code>C</code> security parameter
if, like above, there is &quot;TLSRequired on&quot in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>.  This case also indicates a disagreement between
the client's security expectations and the security policy you have configured
on the server.
