<p>
ProFTPD's <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> configuration sections allow for
powerful fine-grained control over who is allowed to use which FTP commands.
This power comes at the price of complexity, however.  This document
describes some of the things to keep in mind when writing
<code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> sections.

<p>
<b>Precedence</b><br>
Perhaps the hardest part of using <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> is understanding
its rules of precedence, which dictate which <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>'s
restrictions apply when.  Precedence is discussed in the directive
documentation, and will be mentioned here.  First, there are three types
of parameters in a <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> directive: &quot;raw&quot;
FTP commands, FTP command groups, and the <code>ALL</code> keyword.

<p>
&quot;Raw&quot; FTP commands are listed <a href="FTP.html">here</a>, including
the RFC-mandated <a href="FTP.html#XCUP">X-variant</a> FTP commands, which are
often missing from a thorough <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> configuration.

<p>
The FTP command groups are:
<ul>
  <li>ALL<br>
    <i>Covering</i>: all FTP commands

  <p>
  <li>DIRS<br>
    <i>Covering</i>: CDUP, CWD, LIST, MDTM, NLST, PWD, RNFR, STAT, XCUP, XCWD, XPWD

  <p>
  <li>LOGIN<br>
    <i>Covering</i>: client logins

  <p>
  <li>READ<br>
    <i>Covering</i>: RETR, SIZE

  <p>
  <li>WRITE<br>
    <i>Covering</i>: APPE, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNTO, STOR, STOU, XMKD, XRMD
</ul>

<p>
<code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>s that use &quot;raw&quot; FTP commands have
the highest precedence, followed by <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>s that use
the command groups, and, having the lowest precedence, the <code>ALL</code>
keyword.  If a <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> has both &quot;raw&quot; commands
and command groups, then it boils down to the order of appearance of
<code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> sections in <code>proftpd.conf</code> that
use the &quot;raw&quot; command in question.

<p>
<b><code>SITE</code> Commands</b><br>
To apply a <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> to a <code>SITE</code> command, combine
&quot;SITE&quot; and the command (<i>e.g.</i> &quot;CHMOD&quot;) by an
underscore (&quot;_&quot;), like so:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit SITE_<i>command</i>&gt;
</pre>
Thus, in order to place a limit on <code>SITE CHMOD</code>, one would have:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit SITE_CHMOD&gt;
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<b>Inheritance</b><br>
Most <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> sections appear within
<code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> sections in <code>proftpd.conf</code>.  This
means that, like the other <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> configuration
effects, the <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>s will be inherited by all subdirectories
that appear in the <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> path, unless explicitly
overridden by a &quot;closer&quot; <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> section.
This means that one could configure a <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> section
denying all FTP commands for all directories, and then explicitly allow
the <code>READ</code> or <code>WRITE</code> FTP command groups in appropriate
subdirectories (<i>e.g.</i> <code>pub/</code> or <code>incoming/</code>
directories).

<p>
<b>Using <code>AllowUser</code></b><br>
There is a catch to using the <code>AllowUser</code> configuration directive
that causes confusion, primarily when a single <code>AllowUser</code>
directive is being used to allow access to some FTP commands only to
certain users.  ProFTPD uses the same function for parsing the
<code>AllowUser</code> and <code>AllowGroup</code> (and other) directives.
This function parses the list of names for such directives as a 
Boolean AND list, which means that each name on the list must evaluate to
TRUE (must match) for the current user in order for the directive to apply.
For <code>AllowGroup</code>, this makes sense, and allows a great deal
of flexibility.  However, it does not make sense for <code>AllowUser</code>,
because a user may not be multiple users at the same time.  This is a known
issue, and a proper, thorough solution is being developed.  In the meantime,
however, there is a workaround for allowing multiple users via the
<code>AllowUser</code> directive.  Rather than listing the users using
a single <code>AllowUser</code>, using a separate <code>AllowUser</code>
for each user.  For example, instead of:
<pre>
  AllowUser bob,dave,wendy
</pre>
try using:
<pre>
  AllowUser bob
  AllowUser dave
  AllowUser wendy
</pre>

<p>
<b>Using <code>Order</code></b><br>
One thing that sometimes trips up some administrators is the difference
between ProFTPD's and Apache's <code>Order</code> configuration directives.
For Apache, an <code>Order</code> of &quot;Allow,Deny&quot; means that
access is <b>denied</b> by default, unless an <code>Allow</code> directive
explicitly allows access; an <code>Order</code> of &quot;Deny,Allow&quot;
means that access is <b>allowed</b> by default, unless a <code>Deny</code>
directive explicitly denies access.  This is different from ProFTPD, where
an <code>Order</code> of &quot;Allow,Deny&quot; <b>allows</b> access by
default, unless denied by a <code>Deny</code> directive; &quot;Deny,Allow&quot;
<b>denies</b> access by default, unless explicitly granted by an
<code>Allow</code> directive.  The developers of ProFTPD felt their
interpretation to be the more &quot;common sense&quot; interpretation, even
though it does not match Apache's interpretation.

<b>Examples</b><br>
Here are examples to help illustrate the use of <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>.
First, a common configuration: an upload-only directory.
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /path/to/uploads&gt;
    &lt;Limit ALL&gt;
      DenyAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;

    &lt;Limit CDUP CWD XCWD XCUP&gt;
      AllowAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;

    &lt;Limit STOR STOU&gt;
      AllowAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
The first <code>&lt;Limit ALL&gt;</code> section blocks use of <i>all</i> FTP
commands within the <code>/path/to/uploads</code> directory.  Having denied
use of all commands, we then proceed to define which commands <i>can</i> be
used.  The <code>CDUP</code> and <code>CWD</code> commands (and their X
variants) should be allowed so that clients can change into and out of the
directory.  Next, <code>STOR</code> and <code>STOU</code> are allowed, so that
clients can actually upload files into the directory (assuming that the
filesystem permissions allow for the client to write files in the directory
as well).  The <code>WRITE</code> command group might have been used, but
that also allows things like creating and deleting subdirectories, which
is usually not wanted in an upload-only configuration.

<p>
This next example shows a &quot;blind&quot; directory, where clients can
upload and download files from the directory, but they cannot see what is
in the directory:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /path/to/dir&gt;
    &lt;Limit LIST NLST&gt;
      DenyAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
That's it.  By default, all commands are allowed in a directory.  By blocking
the two FTP commands used to list a directory's contents (<i>i.e.</i>
<code>LIST</code> and <code>NLST</code>), we have effectively blocked the
client from seeing anything in the directory.

<p>
Cautious system administrators may want only a few select system users to be
able to connect to their <code>proftpd</code> server--all other users are
to be denied access.  The <code>LOGIN</code> command group is designed for
just this scenario:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;
    AllowUser barb
    AllowUser dave
    AllowGroup ftpuser
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
</pre>
This allows the users <code>barb</code> and <code>dave</code>, as well as
any user in the <code>ftpuser</code> group, to login.  All other users will
be denied.

<p>
What if a site wished to allow <b>only</b> anonymous access?  This would be
configured using the <code>LOGIN</code> command group, as above:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;

  &lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;
    &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;
      AllowAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/Anonymous&gt;
</pre>

The <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> section outside of the
<code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> section denies logins to everyone.  However,
the <code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> section has a <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>
that allows everyone to login; anonymous logins are allowed, and non-anonymous
logins are denied.

<p>
Another related question often asked is &quot;How can I limit a user to only
being able to login from a specific range of IP addresses?&quot;  The
<code>&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;</code> can be used, in conjunction with the
<a href="../../contrib/mod_ifsession.html">mod_ifsession</a> module and a
<a href="Classes.html">Class</a>, to configure this:
<pre>
  &lt;Class friends&gt;
    From 1.2.3.4/8
  &lt;/Class&gt;

  &lt;IfUser dave&gt;
    &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;
      AllowClass friends
      DenyAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
  &lt;/IfUser&gt;
</pre>
Note that the same effect can be achieved by using the
<a href="../../contrib/mod_wrap.html">mod_wrap</a> module to configure
user-specific allow/deny files.

<p>
One situation that often arises is one where the administrator would like
to give users the ability to upload and dowload files from a given directory,
but not to be able to delete files from that directory.  This cannot be
accomplished using normal Unix filesystem permissions, for if a user has
write permission on a directory (necessary for uploading files to that
directory) they also have delete permissions.  In Unix, a directory file
serves as a sort of &quot;table of contents&quot;, tracking the files in
the directory.  Adding or removing a file are thus changes on the directory
file, and do not involve checking the permissions on the file being added
or removed.  This is also how a non-root user can delete files that are owned
by root and only have user-write permissions.  So how then can a site
be configured to allow writes but not deletes?  By using a configuration
similar to the following:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /path/to/dir&gt;
    &lt;Limit DELE&gt;
      AllowUser ftpadm
      DenyAll
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
This will allow the user <code>ftpadm</code> to delete files in the
<code>/path/to/dir</code>, but no other users.

<p>
The FTP protocol has two types of data transfers: active and passive.  In
some configurations, only one type of transfer is allowed by the network
(<i>e.g.</i> active transfers should be denied because clients are sending
the wrong IP addresses).  The ability to place a <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>
on the FTP commands response for active and passive data transfers was
added to ProFTPD in 1.2.10rc1.  If you are using that version or later,
you can use the following to block active transfers:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit PORT&gt;
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
</pre>
Or, conversely, to block passive data transfers:
<pre>
  &lt;Limit PASV&gt;
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
</pre>
