	* added newbuild.diff (Jonathan)
	  Enabled lots of warnings for GCC.
	  (src/Arch.rules, src/Makefile.rules):
	  Tidying: Moved defines, libraries and compiler flags into these two
	    files.
	  Tidying: Simplified the layout, so libraries and headers for a
	    specific config option are together (before they were separated).
	  Tidying: Simplified how libraries are handled - now they only need to be
	    added to one variable, rather than five.
	  Bugfix: Corrected a few options that were added to CFLAGS rather than
	    DEFINES or INCLUDES.
	  (src/*/Makefile [but not src/demos/*]):
	  Tidying: Removing options that were moved into Makefile.rules
	  Tidying: Removing the (now empty) compiler flags section of these
	    Makefiles.
	  (src/fonts/*/Makefile):
	  Tidying: Removing these Makefiles that did nothing.
	* added minormakefixes.diff: (Jonathan)
	  (src/mwin/bmp/convbmp.c):
	  Bugfix: Display a fatal error if the specified filename is longer
	    than the fixed-sized filename buffer, instead of crashing.
	  Bugfix: Make the fixed-size filename buffer longer.
	  Feature: Add -o option to specify the output file name.
	    (Previously it always computed this from the input file name.
	    The old behaviour still applies if you do not specify -o)
	  (src/Makefile.rules):
	  Bugfix: Don't redirect output of convbmp, it doesn't produce
	    output on standard out (even before my modifications).
	    Use the -o option to specify the output file.
	  Bugfix: "make clean" would delete all files in src/ if the
	    bin/ directory did not exist.
	* clean up demo program declarations to eliminate warnings (Jonathan)
	* added LIRC keyboard support, MWKEY_HAVI keys (LIRCKBD=Y) (Jonathan)

	* move to portable locking mechanism in lock.h as default (Jon)
	* allow GrMoveWindow to use quick blit in portrait mode
	* move to only two builtin fonts: MWFONT_SYSTEM_VAR, MWFONT_SYSTEM_FIXED
		- original MWFONT_GUI_VAR moved to MWFONT_SYSTEM_VAR
		- should change applications that request MWFONT_GUI_VAR to
			use MWFONT_SYSTEM_VAR instead
		- original MWFONT_SYSTEM_VAR and MWFONT_OEM_FIXED removed
		- deprecated MWFONT_GUI_VAR (redirected to MWFONT_SYSTEM_VAR)
		- deprecated MWFONT_OEM_FIXED (redirected to MWFONT_SYSTEM_FIXED)
	* added very cool support for Cygwin X11 (Nano-X on X11 on Win32!) (Jon)
	* re-inserted special hack for portait mode pixmap handling in genmem.c
	* added auto UC16 conversion to handle large (non-ASCII) bdf fonts
		- requires loading converted bdf file as .fnt file
		- any BDF can now be used to display international chars
			convert font using fonts/convbdf.c: "convbdf -f *.bdf"
		- MWTF_DBCS_* flags can be used with font for DBCS encoding
		- this is the new preferred method for Chinese,Japanese & Korean
	* speed up PCF font output for ASCII fonts

	* fix GrCreateFont to return ID 0 when font not found
Version 0.89pl11 - 07 Apr 2003 - greg@censoft.com
	* change to allow GrCreateFont w/height=0 to work with loadable fonts
		- if height=0 specified with scalable fonts, must call
			GrSetFontSize with height before rendering
		- if height=0 specified with non-scalable fonts,  height ignored
		- if height specified, will always return some font
		- if height=0 specified and font not found, may return 0 rather 
			than builtin font
	* added lfClass to MWLOGFONT, allows specifying renderer
	* added native loadable .fnt support (use fonts/convbdf.c -f to create)
	* added enhanced fonts/convbdf, fonts/convbdf.c:
		- allows fonts with > 256 chars
		- allows fonts with bitmap offsets > 64k (offset now long array)
		- offset and widths list not generated when not required
		- start, limit options & defaultchar
	* removed HAVEMSFONTS option
	* slight speed increase on dashed drawing, reformatted devdraw.c
	* increase text draw speed with no-clip drawbitmap internal function
	* rewrote and moved all DBCS code into engine/devfont.c and font_dbcs.c
		- added MWTF_DBCS_BIG5, MWTF_DBCS_EUCCN, MWTF_DBCS_EUCKR,
		MWTF_DBCS_EUCJP, MWTF_DBCS_JIS: must use w/GrText for builtin fonts
		- "count" parameter with dbcs is byte-length of dbcs string
		- can use MWTF_DBCS_* flags with any (UC16-indexed) fonts now
		- can use multiple DBCS encodings and fonts at same time
		- can use DBCS encoding with non-compiled-in fonts, encoding is
		seperate from specially-compiled-in fonts.

	* renamed GdSetForeground to GdSetForegroundPixelVal (and GdSetBackground)
	* added AF_INET client/server, NXDISPLAY env variable
	* added text speedup patch, no per-point clipping in visible
		case in GdBitmap and corefont_textdraw.  Also clear
		background once not per char.  Changed GetTextBits
		driver entry point to not copy font data. 60% improvment (Aaron)
		Note this change eliminates max fixed font sizes for all
		fonts except those requiring textbits copy (e.g. font_eujp.c)
	* added USE_CCACHE=1 environment variable check for cached builds
	* added StretchBlitEx driver entry point, GdStretchBlitEx,

Version 0.89pl7 - 24 Feb 2003 - greg@censoft.com
	* APPLIED mw_phillips_fontnetworkbug.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Added GrCreateLogFont nxRequest.
	* Removing the hardcoded 64-character limit on font names.
	  This caused problems with FreeType 2, because the font names
	  are just filenames.  The network layer no longer
	  restricts font name length, but there is still a
	  potential buffer overflow in devfont.c.

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_freetype2.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Added FreeType 2 support, HAVE_FREETYPE_2_SUPPORT in config

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_drawarea.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Added new DrawArea blitters.  Controlled by the defines
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_COPY, MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_ALPHAMAP,
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_ALPHACOL,
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_BITMAP_BYTES_LSB_FIRST, and
	   MW_FEATURE_PSDOP_BITMAP_BYTES_MSB_FIRST in device.h.
	   Usually called through GdDrawAreaInternal() in devdraw.c.

	* fixed nxroach GrArea alpha bug (BLACK used in GrArea crash)

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_alpha.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Adds 8-bit alpha value to MWCOLORVAL value, new fblin32alpha.c
	* Added MWPF_TRUECOLOR8888 pixel type.
	* Adding MWIMAGE_ALPHA_CHANNEL flag.
	* Changes to GdDrawImage() to simplify, fix a
	  24bpp bug, and to add the MWIMAGE_ALPHA_CHANNEL flag.
	* Adding MWROP_USE_GC_MODE option to GrCopyArea
	* Adding a default implementation to fb.h for the new Porter-Duff
	  blending rules, which assumes that both SRC and DST have
	  alpha=1.0.  Drivers that actually support alpha should not
	  use these macros in Porter-Duff modes.
	* MWMODE_XOR_FGBG implementation
	* Adding Porter-Duff MWMODE and MWROP codes,
	  renumbering some existing MWROP codes to prevent collisions.
	  Adding MWMODE_XOR_FGBG and MWROP_XOR_FGBG
	* Adding MWMODE_TO_ROP() macro.
	* Adding code to choose between 8/8/8/8 and 0/8/8/8
	  modes on 32-bit displays, depending on whether or not the
	  display claims to support alpha.
	* New 32-bit with alpha driver: fblin32alpha.c.
	* Adding GR_ARGB() - just calls MWARGB().
	* Rewriting MWRGB() to set the alpha to 255 (opaque).
	* Adding MWARGB() macro
	* Use new GrSetGCForegroundPixelVal() API rather than the
	  deprecated MWPALINDEX() macro.
	  *** NON-BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE API CHANGE: ***
	  Removing MWF_PALINDEX and MWPALINDEX().  They don't work
	  due to the alpha blending changes.  Clients should be
	  modified to use GrSetGCForegroundPixelVal(index) instead
	  of GrSetGCForeground(MWPALINDEX(index)), and similarly to use
	  GrSetGCBackgroundPixelVal() to set the background color.

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_color.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* API changes to allow later alpha patch.
	* Added GrSetGCForegroundPixelVal, GrSetGCBackgroundPixelVal
	* Added new functions GdSetForegroundColor() and GdSetBackgroundColor
		GdSetForeground/GdSetBackground now takes MWPIXELVAL only.
	* Added fgispixelval and bgispixelval flags to GR_GC and GR_GC_INFO.
	* Added a PSD parameter to GdSetForeground() and GdSetBackground(),
		GdFindColor().  Allows multiple color depths to be supported
		at the same time by different PSDs
	* (wingdi.c) Using GdGetColorRGB() instead of a switch()
	  statement that duplicated it's functionality.
	* Replacing GdSetForeground(GdFindColor(c))
	  with GdSetForegroundColor(psd,c) - note the extra PSD
	  parameter.  Similarly for GdSetBackgroundColor().
	* New function GdGetColorRGB(), the inverse of GdFindColor().
	* Preventing multiple arc draws - this was causing
	  problems in XOR and alpha-blending drawing modes.

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_x11.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Major speed enhancements to X11 screen driver.
	* Resizing the window caused an assert() fail and
	  crash.  Added a call to set size hints on the window, indicating
	  it's not resizable.
	* Handle true color X modes correctly.  The previous
	  code made the assumption that a X always lays out it's colors
	  in exactly the same way as MicroWindows.  This is incorrect.
	  For example, some Microsoft Windows based X servers use BGR
	  rather than RGB ordering.
	* If we are in true color mode, then we try hard to
	  get a true color X window if the server can support it.  This
	  is a huge speed boost with a 32-bit Nano-X app, properly
	  antialiased fonts (so we use lots of colors) and an old 8-bit
	  palettised display.  (In 3/3/2 RGB mode we can compute color
	  values easily.  In 8-bit palettised mode we have to do a very
	  expensive lookup).
	* An alternative blit implementation.  Since we are
	  maintaining a separate off-screen copy of the display, we
	  perform all blits on this copy, then simply copy the offscreen
	  data onto the screen.  The only exception are simple copies (no
	  raster ops) between parts of the screen - these are handled by
	  the server to save us having to send an image across the
	  connection.
	* Added PIXEL332RED8 and PIXEL332RED32 macros to device.h

	* APPLIED mw_phillips_1.diff (Jonathan)
	  Contributed by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.
	* Misc build system changes.
	* Added .cvsignore for CVS
	* Initial support for the TriMedia media processor.  Not complete.
	* Added INSTALL_USER, INSTALL_GROUP, and INSTALL_GROUP_2 options.
	* Correcting install target so that libraries
	  are writable by the user who owns the file.
	* Rewriting subdirs target so that the build stops on error.
	* added config option HAVETEXTMODE, removed from scr_fb.c
	* Added config option GPROF=Y for profiling support.
	* Added config option BIGENDIAN=Y/N, may define MW_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to 1.
