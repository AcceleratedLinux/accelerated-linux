TuxChess is a graphical chess program for the MicroWindows environment.
It was designed predominately to run on the TuxScreen, but will also
run quite happily on other architectures.

The chess engine is Copyright 1997 by Tom Kerrigan, and used with 
permission (see README.chess)

Essentially, I have taken Tom's chess engine, and bolted a GUI on the
front end. Tom's code required a user to enter a move on the keyboard,
and printed an ASCII art board. I have modified this so that a user now
presses on a touchscreen to choose the piece they want to move, and where
they want to move it to. Likewise, a full-color graphical display is used
to show the current board position.

The GUI was designed to be easily customised. The board and all pieces are
individual GIF files allowing a user to easily replace the standard pieces
with something they like. For example, instead of black versus white, why
not try Simpsons versus Southpark?

The user can choose to play either black or white - to play white, simply
run "./tuxchess" without any arguments. However, to play black, at least
one argument must be provided, "./tuxchess black" for example.

See the TODO file for planned features.
