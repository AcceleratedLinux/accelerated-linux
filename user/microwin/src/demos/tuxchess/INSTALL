INSTALLATION:

TuxChess has been designed to be incorporated into the standard
MicroWindows source tree. 

It should be untarred into microwin/src/demos/tuxchess.

Typing 'make' in the src directory should build tuxchess and
copy the binary into src/bin.

By default, tuxchess requires all the image files to be available in
/usr/local/images/tuxchess. You will have to manually copy all files
from tuxchess/images to this directory. Alternatively, change the
#define in images.c to something more suitable.
