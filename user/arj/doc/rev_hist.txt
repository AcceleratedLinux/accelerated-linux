====================

   2.61.01   08/11/1998   First alpha version. Minimal functionality.
   2.61.02   09/11/1998   Environment filtering to avoid near memory shortage,

   2.61.04   12/11/1998   Help facility works, ARJSFXJR/2 added, -h2p & -h2d
                          switches added, Host OS changed to OS/2, free space
                          on HPFS volumes (up to 4GB) is now determined
                          correctly.
   2.61.05   13/11/1998   Removed ARJSFXV size limitation. The efforts are now
                          aimed on ARJSFXV conversion...
   2.61.06   15/11/1998   Fixed a glitch with "arj m ..." creating ARJSFXV
                          archives. Note that if no files are found, "arj m"
                          leaves a temporary file. It's the glitch of original
                          ARJ 2.61, and it's left for compatibility.
                          ARJSFXV: Minimal functionality achieved (no LFN yet).

   2.61.11   26/11/1998   ARJ/2 2.61.10 would cause exception 0Dh if ARJ$DISP
                          is killed from the task list. The "clear screen" ANSI
                          sequence now works.

   2.76.03   19/06/2001   Merged with later 2.75 builds, yielding a separate
                          post-2.76.02 sparse tree.
   2.76.04   21/06/2001   Added a free memory check for DOS version. Fixed the
                          "r" command to remove paths properly in dual-name
                          archives. Fixed an error processing directories with
                          very long filenames. Fixed ARJSFXV to NOT beep when
                          using options to inhibit volume prompting. Fixed
                          ARJSFXV to work with an archive that contains the
                          encryption module. Fixed phantom EA records.
   2.76.05   24/06/2001   Changed order of password prompt in the large
                          self-extractors.
   2.76.06   15/08/2001   Fixed launch of DOS archivers from REARJ. ARJSFX now
                          automatically enables the VIO ANSI support for
                          comments. Fixed error messages appearing when -hk
                          is used with -va. Added a way to specify priority
                          deltas. Made some performance enhancements to the -m4
                          extractor.
   2.76.07   25/08/2001   Added handling of the new (revision 11) timestamp
                          format.

   2.77.01   01/09/2001   ARJDISP is now being called instead of ARJ$DISP as
                          the display front-end. ARJ.CFG syntax was enhanced to
                          allow comments ('#' as the first character on a
                          line). Preliminary support for UNIX-like platforms.
                          REARJ has been enhanced with a "T" modifier. Fixed
                          the parsing of -t1g. Specifying -t0 on extraction
                          will retain the 8th bit.
   2.77.02   06/09/2001   Fixed file mode conversion to the DOS format. Fixed
                          ARJCRYPT incompatibility. Fixed deletion of special
                          files. Fixed "-2a" to work correctly with the
                          ".*" files.
   2.77.03   07/09/2001   Fixed DOS->UNIX timestamp conversions.
   2.77.04   09/09/2001   Fixed -hk protection block size calculation. Fixed
                          the updating of archives with extended headers.
   2.77.05   15/09/2001   Fixed the display of archive dates in DOS and OS/2
                          versions of ARJ. Fixed some EXT_HDR regressions in
                          16-bit mode.
   2.77.06   23/10/2001   Fixed handling of "-2f". Removed the dependence of
                          /usr/bin path in UNIX platforms. Changed the names
                          of configuration files in home directory to be
                          prepended with '.'.

   2.78.01   27/03/2002   Merged with German NLS branch. Fixed the "-i5"
                          indicator to show correct percentage at the
                          beginning of each file.
   2.78.02   09/04/2002   Official Open Source release.
   2.78.03   03/05/2002   Fixed modification timestamping in main
                          archive header.
   2.78.04   15/05/2002   Fixed handling of "+" and "-" in ARJ.CFG (regression
                          from 2.73.01)
   2.78.05   06/07/2002   Fixed timestamp handling. Fixed crash at startup
                          with "ARJ Q" and no other arguments. Added "-d1" and
                          "-d2" options.
   2.78.06   14/12/2002   Fixed "Out of memory" type errors on UNIX-like
                          platforms.
   2.78.07   25/01/2003   Fixed ARJCRYPT key generation (regression from
                          2.77.02). Added preliminary support for Win32
                          platform.
   2.78.08   07/02/2003   Install into /usr/local by default on UNIX-like
                          platforms. Determine the number of lines on screen
                          for -jp where possible (DOS, OS/2 VIO and Win32).
                          Experimental color output in a JAR style:
                          1. "-*2" gets obsoleted. "-*1" designates a "silent"
                             mode (all error msgs suppressed), "-*" stands for
                             the "normal" mode (error msgs still displayed).
                          2. ARJ has "-2t" switch to set the colors. "-2t" alone
                             will disable the color support; "- -2t" in ARJ.CFG
                             is recommended to turn it off for all commands.
                          3. REARJ has a "COLORS " configuration parameter.
                          REARJ updated to 2.43 - allow arbitrary positioning of
                          parameters within the configuration file.
                          Fixed looping on symlinked directories without "-a1".
                          Added the "-2b" parameter to specify reference devices.
                          German locale: "ge" -> "de". Fixed to display error
                          messages properly under Win32.
   2.78.09   31/03/2003   Prevent "ghost" progress indicator from appearing on
                          the screen. Added hardlink to symlink conversion.
                          Removed counter granularity (actually, it's 26624 now
                          in the most cases instead of 40960). Added the "-2r"
                          parameter to revert to the "standard" unarchiving order.
   2.78.10   03/04/2003   Workaround for stack/near memory shortage in 16-bit
                          versions.
   2.78.11   06/04/2003   Fixed several options being disabled in REARJ.
                          Fixed stack overrun during directory recursion in
                          32-bit OS/2 (except EMX).
   2.78.12   12/04/2003   Fixed a possible incompatibility with mainstream ARJ
                          when using the "-hg" or "-hg!" encryption.
   2.78.13   11/05/2003   Revised build and packaging on GNU systems after a
                          patch from Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>:
                          * The build system honours DESTDIR, so our packaging
                            is easier.
                          * Updated configure.in.
                          * The arjcrypt module is moved to its own dir under
                            $libdir ($pkglibdir).
                          * The join program now return proper exit codes. It
                            was causing the autobuilders to fail on some
                            architectures.
                          * Man pages provided.
                          * The rearj.cfg.example now supplies the correct
                            bzip2 options.
                          Changed the OS/2 version to use the same canonical
                          wildcard matching logic as the Win32 one.
                          Fixed "-jp" being inoperable (regression from
                          2.78.08). Fixed the unintentional fallback to
                          ARJCRYPT V1 when ARJCRYPT V2 ought to be used.
                          Displays the safety factor in ARJ-PROTECT notice.
                          Fixed the "arj o" command (regression from 2.62.08).
   2.78.14   14/05/2003   Fixed REARJ terminating with an error when the
                          configuration file is padded with blank lines.
   2.78.15   30/06/2003   Fixed the "-i" overall progress indicators to not
                          count the skipped files. Fixed "double skip" with
                          "-2b" when the first file to be skipped was
                          surrounded by symlinks. Fixed to ignore symlink
                          access attributes. Workaround for EA size query
                          during extraction on OS/2-32. Fixed various problems
                          with updating extended headers (regression from
                          2.77.01).
   2.78.16   15/07/2003   Added "-2o2" to save a symbolic representation of
                          both UID and GID when archiving.
   2.78.17   14/09/2003   Skip changing the archive attributes under UNIX.
                          Optimized the progress counter performance by
                          avoiding unnecessary output.
   2.78.18   16/10/2003   Re-fix the attributes patch for 2.78.17 to make
                          the SFX attributes correspond to the current
                          umask.
   2.78.19   21/02/2004   Do not ask for pause when "arj -?" is redirected.
                          "-t1g" replaces the non-trivial "-t1gf". Bell is
                          handled correctly with the new console output.
                          Corrected lookup for arjcrypt.so on UNIX-like
                          platforms (regression from 2.78.13). Archiving
                          with "-2l" on platforms without EA support would
                          produce malformed filenames. Added the "-_" option
                          to store/restore filenames in lowercase.
   2.78.20   18/04/2004   Prevent the -jz comments from being automatically
                          appended with newline. "-jb" failed to pick the
                          requested chapters (regression from 2.62.08).
   2.78.21   18/06/2004   Registration wizard reported error on many
                          platforms (regression from 2.78.15). Fixed OEM/ANSI
                          discrepancies that showed up in Win32 version when
                          obtaining filenames from argv[]. Copying temporary
                          files with "-jt" enabled might result in a
                          "CRC error". Added "-2i". Introduced new modifiers
                          (G/T/P/E) and hexadecimal prefix format to numeric
                          parameters. Fixed the inability to sustain binary
                          mode for "arj p" under OS/2-32.
