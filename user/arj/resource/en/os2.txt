   This product is an OS/2-hosted add-on for ARJ v @COUNTERPARTS for DOS. It may be
   used  separately  from  the DOS  package  but  it doesn't  contain  the
   documentation found in DOS release.

   INTRODUCTION

      This file describes the features specific to the OS/2 port. It is
      suggested that you read the general README file prior to this one.


   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   16-bit version:

      *  OS/2 version 1.2 or higher, or Windows NT v 3.10 or higher.
   For OS/2 systems:
      *  A 80286 or higher CPU.
      *  512K of free memory
   For Windows NT systems:
      *  1024K of free memory

   32-bit version:

      *  OS/2 version 3.0 with Fixpak 25 or higher
      *  A 80386SX or higher CPU.
      *  1024K of free memory (512K for each subsequent  instance after
         the first one has been started)
      *  IBM LIBC and Unicode runtime  support (installed by default as
         a mandatory component)


   IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

      *  External garble modules are provided as OS/2 DLLs. You may not
         use DOS  modules  with  ARJ/2, or vice  versa. The  encryption
         algorithm  is  the  same, so  ARJ/2 garbled  archives can   be
         processed under DOS.

      *  ARJ/2  sets  the  "Host OS" to  "OS/2"  on its  archives. When
         extracting  any such  archive with ARJ  for DOS,  some unusual
         behavior  may  occur. Versions  of ARJ  prior to 2.50  convert
         high-ASCII  characters in  filenames to  7-bit  characters  by
         ignoring the  high  bit. So, the  filename  "±TEST±"  will  be
         converted to "1TEST1" on extraction.

         ARJ/DOS also strips high  bit from  archive comments, but only
         if the archive  was created  by ARJ/2. Archives  created  with
         ARJ/DOS  and  then  processed   under OS/2  are not  affected.

         Beginning  with version  2.72, ARJ/DOS considers  the ARJSFXJR
         archives created  under OS/2 to be hostile  to the DOS version
         of ARJSFXJR and  therefore cannot  modify them. In such cases,
         it's advised to use the "-2d" switch under OS/2.

      *  ARJ/2 uses the  default OS/2 error  handler that will normally
         display  pop-up menus  prompting  for action.  The  -&  option
         installs batch error and  exception handler (new feature since
         ARJ/2 v 2.62.08). Remember  that the  ampersand  character  is
         used  in OS/2 to start  two  processes  consequently, so  this
         switch will actually split  the command line. Type -^& instead
         of -& to install the error handler.

      *  ARJSFXJR  archives will  display  ANSI sequences  if the  ANSI
         support is enabled  in the  current OS/2 session (it's enabled
         by default in OS/2).

      *  By default, ARJ/2 stores extended attributes among with files.
         To  disable  EA  storage  and thus revert  to  the traditional
         header format, use  the "-2e" option. See  a special dedicated
         section in the main README file for details on EA handling.

      *  "-2p<n>:<d>" can be used to adjust the  priority of ARJ/2. The
         knowledge  of OS/2 scheduling system  is required to  use this
         option. It can dramatically increase performance but slow down
         other processes. The <n> can be equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4:

          1 = idle-time priority
          2 = regular priority
          3 = time-critical priority
          4 = fixed-high priority

         Priority delta values can be given in <d> (defaults to 0). The
         range  for <d> is -31 to 31.  So, "-2p2"  corresponds  to  the
         regular  process  priority, and "-2p3:31"  gives  the  maximum
         time-critical priority.

      *  ARJSFXJR does  not  support  long filenames  under Win95  DOS.
         ARJSFXJR in ARJ/2 supports OS/2 long filenames.


   KNOWN PROBLEMS

      *  On FAT volumes under Windows NT, both long filenames and short
         filenames may be used to specify a filename. If you refer to a
         file  with its  short name (e.g. "ARJ a lntest LONGFI~1.TXT"),
         the short filename will be stored as entered from console. So,
         no LFN equivalent is placed  into the  archive, and if  a file
         with a  similar long  filename exists in the  archive, it will
         not be replaced.

      *  REARJ/2 may  behave incorrectly  if  the  command  interpreter
         (specified   with  COMSPEC=   environment  variable)  is   not
         compatible with CMD.EXE. It's also unwise to  rename REARJ.EXE
         since  it  calls itself recursively  when  converting archives
         within archives (/a).

      *  No LIBC is supplied with fixes prior to XR_W032. For use  with
         32-bit ARJ/2, the  LIBCS.DLL, LIBUNI.DLL and UCONV.DLL  may be
         obtained in the OS/2 v 4.00 release (9.023). XR_W032 and later
         CSDs do not require any special action.
