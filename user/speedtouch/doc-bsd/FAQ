                         Speedtouch USB Driver for *BSD
                           Frequently Asked Questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the kernel doesn't attach the modem
modem_run or pppoa2 can't locate the modem
rates are under those you should have
modem doesn't connect on first connection
driver doesn't compile when i type make

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : modem isn't found by the kernel

Solution : check that the option 'Assign IRQ to USB' is checked in your bios
           and that Not PnP OS is selected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : modem_run or pppoa2 doesn't manage to find the modem

Solution : This problem can be due to several things.

1. check that you modem is found by your kernel.
You should find that in your dmesg :
            ugen0: ALCATEL Speed Touch USB , rev 1.10/0.00, addr 2
it can also be ugen1 or ugen2 or ... depending of the usb hardware connected.

2. check that all the entries are created in /dev :
 a. If you have several usb controler, you might need to create entries for usb1
    (or usbX where X is a number)
    cd /dev && ./MAKEDEV usbX (where X is the number of the controler)
 b. If you have several usb hardware connected, you might need to crate entries
    for ugen1 (or ugenX where X is a number).
    cd /dev && ./MAKEDEV ugenX 
    ugenX must be the same as the one you have in the dmesg.

3. If modem_run still doesn't manage to locate the modem, then you can specify
   it in the command line with option : -d /dev/ugenX (ugenX still the same 
   as the one you created just before and also the same as in the dmesg)

   tips : Don't forget to add '-d /dev/ugenX' in the pppoa2 line in ppp.conf

   example : # modem_run -v 1 -m -d /dev/ugen0 -f /usr/local/libdata/mgmt.o
   and in ppp.conf : device !"pppoa2 -vpi 8 -vci 35 -d /dev/ugen0"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : rates are under those you should have.

Solution : You can increase the number of mbufs by compiling a new kernel with
           an increased value of `maxusers' and/or NMBCLUSTERS.
           You can also change NMBCLUSTERS with kern.ipc.nmbclusters.

Explanation : The driver uses too many mbufs, and sometimes it get out of mbufs.
              This is a bug of the driver and we are trying to correct that.

Example :
add the following line in /boot/loader.conf :
kern.ipc.nmbclusters="4096"

or play wuth thses values in your kernel :
maxusers        32
options         NMBCLUSTERS=4096

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : modem doesn't connect on first connection.

Solution : connect a second time.

Explanation : That's another bug of the driver, in some cases, pppoa2 doesn't
              fork well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : connection is ok but i can't access any site.

Solution : 2 possible mistake :
First, a little test to see if the connection is ok. Try to ping the computer
you are connected to.
example:
`ifconfig tun0' show you :
tun0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet6 fe80::2e0:18ff:fe90:9b25%tun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7 
        inet 8.1.1.10 --> 8.1.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 
        Opened by PID 666
Then try to do : `ping 8.1.1.1'

If the ping works, then your connection is ok and you just have a little problem
of configuration with your network. Else, your connection doesn't work, check
your ppp and pppoax logs.

* Check your DNS in /etc/resolv.conf
  that should look like : 
nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx


* Check that your routing table is ok : `netstat -rn'
  If your default route doesn't point to the computer you are connected to, you 
  can specify the default route manually with : 
`route add default' then the IP of the remote host
example : `route add default 8.1.1.1'

You can also force ppp to set the default route by changing in ppp.conf :
`add default HISADDR' by `add! default HISADDR'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : Driver doesn't compile when i type `make' and I get the following
           message :
   "Makefile", line 10: Could not find speedtouch.tmpl
   make: fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue

Solution : type first : `./configure' then `make'

Explanation : You didn't read the INSTALL notes carefully

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem  : I can't find the logs of pppoa2 and for modem_run

Solution : You need to add some lines to /etc/syslog.conf or disable this
           functionality

For syslog.conf, you should add the following lines (FreeBSD) :
!pppoa2
*.*                                             /var/log/pppoa2.log
!modem_run
*.*                                             /var/log/modem_run.log

I think it's different for OpenBSD (and NetBSD) as you should find log in 
/var/log/messages

To disable syslog with the driver, you need to do :
./configure --enable-syslog=no
the ``make'' and ``make'' install as usually.
