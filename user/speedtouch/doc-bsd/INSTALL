0. Official website

The official website of the project is located at:
    http://speedtouch.sf.net
You will find there all the lastest informations, docs and files about this 
driver.


1. Download

Here are the files you need: 

* speedtouch-1.1.tar.gz
    on http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/speedtouch/speedtouch-1.1.tar.gz
    or http://www.xsproject.org/speedtouch/files/speedtouch-1.1.tar.gz
* speedmgmt.tar.gz from Thomson Site
    http://www.speedtouchdsl.com/dvrreg_lx.htm

Using the CVS: 
You can also grab the source from the CVS (need a connection) which is under
sourceforge.net. Type the following line:
cvs -z3 -r -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.speedtch.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/speedtch
co speedtouch
This will create a directory speedtouch with the source in it. Later you can
upgrade the source by typing only `cvs update`.


2. Requirements

This driver is working under:
     * FreeBSD: since 4.2 and since 5.1
     * OpenBSD: since 2.9
     * NetBSD : since 1.5
For FreeBSD 5.0 you need the patch posted there:
http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=947410+0+archive/2003/freebsd-current/20030511.freebsd-current

You need to have the USB, ugen and ppp support in your kernel (always included
by default) and all the corresponding entries of your usb controler and modem
entries in the /dev (automatically created with FreeBSD 5)

For NetBSD, you need the user-ppp version that I ported and is available at:
http://www.xsproject.org/speedtouch
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/speedtouch/userppp-013007.tar.gz?download


3. Compilation & Installation

This driver is GPL software, so best distributed in source form. That means you
have to compile it before using it.

* Extract the Alcatel file:

tar -zxvf speedmgmt.tar.gz 

Then copy 'mgmt.o' to /usr/local/libdata
(you can also use the file 'alcaudsl.sys' from the windows version) 

* Extract, compile and install the driver:

tar -zxvf speedtouch-1.1.tar.gz
cd speedtouch-1.1
./configure
make
make install (need to be root)

You have to copy the file (save your old ppp.conf before):
cp /usr/local/share/doc/speedtouch/ppp.conf.sample /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
chmod 600 /etc/ppp/ppp.conf


4. Configuration

edit the file /etc/ppp/ppp.conf and modify:
    * <login>
    * <password>
    * <VPI> and <VCI>: check a list of known values in vpivci file.

5. Connection

You can use the script adsl.sh.sample provided.
It is usually located in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
To launch the connection during boot sequence, you need to rename it adsl.sh
and verify that it has the executable bit.

To launch connection manually, here are the 2 steps that need to be done in the
order:

* Initialisation 

Initialisation of the modem (you need to do that each time you plug in the modem
or when you restart your computer) 
    modem_run -f /usr/local/libdata/mgmt.o -m


* Launch the connection : PPP
    ppp -background adsl
(see the `man ppp` for other options like auto, natd or ddial)
 
Now you should be connected. To close the connection, type :
killall ppp (For FreeBSD)
