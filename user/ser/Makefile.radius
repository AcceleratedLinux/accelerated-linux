#
# Radiusclient library detection comes here
#
# (To be included from Makefiles of radius related modules)
#
# The purpose of this makefile is to perform radiusclient library
# detection and setup library and include paths in DEFS and LIBS
# variables. In addition RADIUSCLIENT_NG_4 will be defined when
# libradiusclient-ng version 4 is detected. That means the module
# should include radiusclient.h, otherwise radiusclient-ng.h
# should be included. Variable RADIUSCLIENT_LIB contains the
# name of the shared library.
#

#
# Radiusclient-ng is often installed from tarballs so we
# need to look int /usr/local/lib as well
#
DEFS+=-I$(LOCALBASE)/include

ifneq ($(radiusclient_ng), 4)

# DEFS+=-DRADIUSCLIENT_NG_5P
