Boa is	a  single-tasking  HTTP  server.  That means that
unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for  each
incoming  connection,  nor  does  it  fork  many copies of
itself to handle multiple connections. It internally  mul-
tiplexes  all  of  the ongoing HTTP connections, and forks
only for CGI programs (which must be separate  processes.)
Preliminary  tests  show Boa is more than twice as fast as
Apache.
