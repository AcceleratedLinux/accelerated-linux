how to make mawk under MsDOS
---------------------------

TurboC: Move msdos\makefile.tcc to makefile

MSC : Move msdos\makefile.msc to makefile
      Currently you don't get wildcard expansion on filenames with
      msc mawk -- this must be simple to fix, if you do please send
      the changes.  (You have to do something with SETARGV in the link
      file)

Assuming you keep the same directory structure:

1)  If you want a Unix style command line for mawk, you'll need to
    write a function called reargv(int *, char ***) which passes
    mawk the modified argc and argv via reargv(&argc,&argv).
    Put it in a file called reargv.c

    The supplied argvmks.c works with the MKS shell.

2)  YACC --
Take some care that you don't trash parse.[ch] unless you're
sure you want to remake them.

3)  The same test suite that is run on mawk under Unix can now
be run under DOS.  See test\mawktest.bat and test\fpe_test.bat.
