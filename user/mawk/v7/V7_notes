				MAWK ON V7 UNIX


09/08/91  Carl Mascott


1.  Prerequisites

hash8 :	from comp.sources.unix volume 15
	used by V7 Makefiles
	When you build hash8 you should add all long ( > 7 char)
	runtime library function names to the reserved word table

memcmp(), memcpy(), memset()
	included in stringlib, comp.sources.unix volume 6
	simple to write if necessary

2.  Procedure

	a.  In ~/mawk:
		Rename Makefile.v7 Makefile
		Rename *.c *.cl
		Rename *.xc *.xcl
		Rename *.h *.hl
		Check CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in Makefile

	    Repeat the applicable portions of the above
	    in ~/mawk/rexp and in ~/mawk/config

	b.  From ~/mawk:
		make config/V7.h
		make config/Idefault.h
		ln config/V7.h config.h

	c.  Do a make in ~/mawk/rexp

	d.  Do a make in ~/mawk

3.  Notes

	a.  V7 sh scripts

The original mawk_test and fpe_test wouldn't run on V7.  V7 sh doesn't
have a comment character ('#').  Since ':' is actually a statement its
arguments need to be quoted if they contain any special characters.

	b.  SW_FP_CHECK

SW_FP_CHECK has been added.  The particular implementation is
for XENIX-68K 2.3A.  There are no checks preceding calls to
fmod() because the check is built into mawk's fmod().  This
would be a problem on a system that needs SW_FP_CHECK but
already has fmod() in the RTL.  The work-around is to always
use mawk's fmod() if using SW_FP_CHECK.

SW_FP_CHECK is activated only if XNX23A is defined.  The
standard V7 Makefile doesn't define XNX23A, so you needn't
concern yourself with SW_FP_CHECK.

	c.  3-argument open()

Mawk always calls open() with the 3rd argument set to 0.  V7
open() really takes only 2 arguments.  With most UNIX C compilers
extra arguments in function calls are harmless, so the open()
calls have not been altered for V7.
