       These instructions allow you to generate your image or
       report.  If you don't use any graph elements, no graph is
       generated.  Similarly, no report is generated if you don't
       use print options.

       PPRRIINNTT::_v_n_a_m_e::_f_o_r_m_a_t
           Depending on the context, either the value component
           or the time component of a VVDDEEFF is printed using _f_o_r_-
           _m_a_t. It is an error to specify a _v_n_a_m_e generated by a
           DDEEFF or CCDDEEFF.

           Any text in _f_o_r_m_a_t is printed literally with one
           exception: The percent character introduces a format-
           ter string. This string can be:

           For printing values:

           *   %%%% just prints a literal '%' character

           *   %%##..##llee prints numbers like 1.2346e+04. The
               optional integers # denote field width and decimal
               precision.

           *   %%##..##llff prints numbers like 12345.6789, with
               optional field width and precision.

           *   %%ss place this after %%llee, %%llff or %%llgg. This will be
               replaced by the appropriate SI magnitude unit and
               the value will be scaled accordingly (123456 ->
               123.456 k).

           *   %%SS is similar to %%ss. It does, however, use a
               previously defined magnitude unit. If there is no
               such unit yet, it tries to define one (just like
               %%ss) unless the value is zero, in which case the
               magnitude unit stays undefined. Thus, formatter
               strings using %%SS and no %%ss will all use the same
               magnitude unit except for zero values.

           For printing times:

           *   %%%% just prints a literal '%' character

           *   %%aa,, %%AA print the abbreviated or full name of the
               day of the week.

           *   %%bb,, %%BB print the abbreviated or full name of the
               month.

           *   %%dd,, %%mm,, %%yy,, %%HH,, %%MM,, %%SS print day, month, year,
               hour, minute, and second in two-digit format.

           *   %%YY prints the year in 4-digit format.

           *   %%II,, %%pp print the hour (01..12), 'am' or 'pm'.

           *   %%jj,, %%ww print day of the week (0..6), day of the
               year (1..366)

           *   %%cc,, %%xx,, %%XX print date+time, date only, time only.

           *   %%UU,, %%WW number of the week of the current year,
               with either the first Sunday (%U) or the first
               Monday (%W) determining the first week.

           *   %%ZZ prints the time zone.

           Text is printed literally in the legend section of the
           graph. Note that in RRDtool 1.2 you have to escape
           colons in COMMENT text in the same way you have to
           escape them in **PPRRIINNTT commands by writing ''\\::''.

           Draw a vertical line at _t_i_m_e.  Its color is composed
           from three hexadecimal numbers specifying the rgb
           color components (00 is off, FF is maximum) red, green
           and blue. Optionally, a legend box and string is
           printed in the legend section. _t_i_m_e may be a number or
           a variable from a VVDDEEFF. It is an error to use _v_n_a_m_es
           from DDEEFF or CCDDEEFF here.

       LLIINNEE[_w_i_d_t_h]::_v_a_l_u_e[##_c_o_l_o_r][::[_l_e_g_e_n_d][::SSTTAACCKK]]
           Draw a line of the specified width onto the graph.
           _w_i_d_t_h can be a floating point number. If the color is
           not specified, the drawing is done 'invisibly'. This
           is useful when stacking something else on top of this
           line. Also optional is the legend box and string which
           will be printed in the legend section if specified.
           The vvaalluuee can be generated by DDEEFF, VVDDEEFF, and CCDDEEFF.  If
           the optional SSTTAACCKK modifier is used, this line is
           stacked on top of the previous element which can be a
           LLIINNEE or an AARREEAA.

           When you do not specify a color, you cannot specify a
           legend.  Should you want to use STACK, use the
           "LINEx:<value>::STACK" form.

       AARREEAA::_v_a_l_u_e[##_c_o_l_o_r][::[_l_e_g_e_n_d][::SSTTAACCKK]]
           See LLIINNEE, however the area between the x-axis and the
           line will be filled.

       TTIICCKK::_v_n_a_m_e##_r_r_g_g_b_b[_a_a][::_f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n[::_l_e_g_e_n_d]]
           Plot a tick mark (a vertical line) for each value of
           _v_n_a_m_e that is non-zero and not *UNKNOWN*. The _f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n
           argument specifies the length of the tick mark as a
           fraction of the y-axis; the default value is 0.1 (10%
           of the axis). Note that the color specification is not
           optional.

       SSHHIIFFTT::_v_n_a_m_e::_o_f_f_s_e_t
           Using this command RRRRDDttooooll will graph the following
           elements with the specified offset.  For instance, you
           can specify an offset of ( 7*24*60*60 = ) 604'800 sec-
           onds to "look back" one week. Make sure to tell the
           viewer of your graph you did this ...  As with the
           other graphing elements, you can specify a number or a
           variable here.

       SSTTAACCKK::_v_n_a_m_e##_c_o_l_o_r[::_l_e_g_e_n_d]

       When stacking, an element is not placed above the X-axis
       but rather on top of the previous element.  There must be
       something to stack upon.

       You can use an iinnvviissiibbllee LINE or AREA to stacked upon.

       An uunnkknnoowwnn value makes the entire stack unknown from that
       moment on.  You don't know where to begin (the unknown
       value) and therefore do not know where to end.

       If you want to make sure you will be displaying a certain
       variable, make sure never to stack upon the unknown value.
       Use a CDEF instruction with IIFF and UUNN to do so.

       A colon ':' in a _l_e_g_e_n_d argument will mark the end of the
       legend. To enter a ':' as part of a legend, the colon must
       be escaped with a backslash '\:'.  Beware that many envi-
       ronments process backslashes themselves, so it may be
       necessary to write two backslashes in order to one being
       passed onto rrd_graph.

       SSttrriinngg FFoorrmmaattttiinngg

       The text printed below the actual graph can be formatted
       by appending special escape characters at the end of a
       text. When ever such a character occurs, all pending text
       is pushed onto the graph according to the character speci-
       fied.

       Valid markers are: \\jj for justified, \\ll for left aligned,
       \\rr for right aligned, and \\cc for centered. In the next
       section there is an example showing how to use centered
       formatting.

       Normally there are two space characters inserted between
       every two items printed into the graph. The space follow-
       ing a string can be suppressed by putting a \\gg at the end
       of the string. The \\gg also ignores any space inside the
       string if it is at the very end of the string. This can be
       used in connection with %%ss to suppress empty unit strings.

        GPRINT:a:MAX:%lf%s\g

       A special case is COMMENT:\\ss which inserts some additional
       vertical space before placing the next row of legends.

       If you are using the proportional font in your graph, you
       can use tab characters or the sequence \\tt to line-up leg-
       end elements. Note that the tabs inserted are relative to
       the start of the current legend element!
