rrddump - dump the contents of an RRD to XML format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rrdtool> B<dump> I<filename.rrd> E<gt> I<filename.xml>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<dump> function prints the contents of an B<RRD> in human
readable (?) XML format. This format can be read by rrdrestore.
Together they allow you to transfer your files from one computer architecture
to another as well to manipulate the contents of an B<RRD> file in a
somewhat more convenient manner.



=over 8

=item I<filename.rrd>
