.TH RRDGRAPH_RPN 1 "2005-06-17" "1.2.10" "rrdtool"
.SH "NAME"
rrdgraph_rpn \- About RPN Math in rrdtool graph
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fI\s-1RPN\s0 expression\fR:=\fIvname\fR|\fIoperator\fR|\fIvalue\fR[,\fI\s-1RPN\s0 expression\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
If you have ever used a traditional \s-1HP\s0 calculator you already know
\&\fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR. The idea behind \fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR is that you have a stack and push
your data onto this stack. Whenever you execute an operation, it
takes as many elements from the stack as needed. Pushing is done
implicitly, so whenever you specify a number or a variable, it gets
pushed onto the stack automatically.
.PP
At the end of the calculation there should be one and only one
value left on the stack.  This is the outcome of the function and
this is what is put into the \fIvname\fR.  For \fB\s-1CDEF\s0\fR instructions,
the stack is processed for each data point on the graph. \fB\s-1VDEF\s0\fR
instructions work on an entire data set in one run.
.PP
Example: \f(CW\*(C`VDEF:maximum=mydata,MAXIMUM\*(C'\fR
.PP
This will set variable \*(L"maximum\*(R" which you now can use in the rest
of your \s-1RRD\s0 script.
.PP
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:mydatabits=mydata,8,*\*(C'\fR
.PP
This means:  push variable \fImydata\fR, push the number 8, execute
the operator \fI+\fR. The operator needs two elements and uses those
to return one value.  This value is then stored in \fImydatabits\fR.
As you may have guessed, this instruction means nothing more than
\&\fImydatabits = mydata * 8\fR.  The real power of \fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR lies in the
fact that it is always clear in which order to process the input.
For expressions like \f(CW\*(C`a = b + 3 * 5\*(C'\fR you need to multiply 3 with
5 first before you add \fIb\fR to get \fIa\fR. However, with parentheses
you could change this order: \f(CW\*(C`a = (b + 3) * 5\*(C'\fR. In \fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR, you
would do \f(CW\*(C`a = b, 3, +, 5, *\*(C'\fR without the need for parentheses.

\&\fB\s-1LT\s0, \s-1LE\s0, \s-1GT\s0, \s-1GE\s0, \s-1EQ\s0, \s-1NE\s0\fR
.Sp
Pop two elements from the stack, compare them for the selected condition
and return 1 for true or 0 for false. Comparing an \fIunknown\fR or an
\&\fIinfinite\fR value will always result in 0 (false).
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1UN\s0, \s-1ISINF\s0\fR
.Sp
Pop one element from the stack, compare this to \fIunknown\fR respectively
to \fIpositive or negative infinity\fR. Returns 1 for true or 0 for false.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1IF\s0\fR
.Sp
Pops three elements from the stack.  If the element popped last is 0
(false), the value popped first is pushed back onto the stack,
otherwise the value popped second is pushed back. This does, indeed,
mean that any value other than 0 is considered to be true.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`A,B,C,IF\*(C'\fR should be read as \f(CW\*(C`if (A) then (B) else (C)\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\&
.IP "Comparing values" 4
.IX Item "Comparing values"
\&\fB\s-1MIN\s0, \s-1MAX\s0\fR
.Sp
Pops two elements from the stack and returns the smaller or larger,
respectively.  Note that \fIinfinite\fR is larger than anything else.
If one of the input numbers is \fIunknown\fR then the result of the operation will be
\&\fIunknown\fR too.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1LIMIT\s0\fR
.Sp
Pops two elements from the stack and uses them to define a range.
Then it pops another element and if it falls inside the range, it
is pushed back. If not, an \fIunknown\fR is pushed.
.Sp
The range defined includes the two boundaries (so: a number equal
to one of the boundaries will be pushed back). If any of the three
numbers involved is either \fIunknown\fR or \fIinfinite\fR this function
will always return an \fIunknown\fR
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:a=alpha,0,100,LIMIT\*(C'\fR will return \fIunknown\fR if
alpha is lower than 0 or if it is higher than 100.

.Sp
\&\fB\s-1SIN\s0, \s-1COS\s0, \s-1LOG\s0, \s-1EXP\s0, \s-1SQRT\s0\fR
.Sp
Sine and cosine (input in radians), log and exp (natural logarithm),
square root.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1ATAN\s0\fR
.Sp
Arctangent (output in radians).
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1ATAN2\s0\fR
.Sp
Arctangent of y,x components (output in radians).
This pops one element from the stack, the x (cosine) component, and then
a second, which is the y (sine) component.
It then pushes the arctangent of their ratio, resolving the ambiguity between
quadrants.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:angle=Y,X,ATAN2,RAD2DEG\*(C'\fR will convert \f(CW\*(C`X,Y\*(C'\fR
components into an angle in degrees.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1FLOOR\s0, \s-1CEIL\s0\fR
.Sp
Round down or up to the nearest integer.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1DEG2RAD\s0, \s-1RAD2DEG\s0\fR
.Sp
Convert angle in degrees to radians, or radians to degrees.
.IP "Set Operations" 4
.IX Item "Set Operations"
\&\fB\s-1SORT\s0, \s-1REV\s0\fR
.Sp
Pop one element from the stack.  This is the \fIcount\fR of items to be sorted
(or reversed).  The top \fIcount\fR of the remaining elements are then sorted
(or reversed) in place on the stack.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:x=v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,6,SORT,POP,5,REV,POP,+,+,+,4,/\*(C'\fR will
compute the average of the values v1 to v6 after removing the smallest and
largest.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1TREND\s0\fR
.Sp
Create a \*(L"sliding window\*(R" average of another data series.
.Sp
Usage:
CDEF:smoothed=x,1800,TREND
.Sp
This will create a half-hour (1800 second) sliding window average of x.  The
average is essentially computed as shown here:

Pushes a positive or negative infinite value on the stack. When
such a value is graphed, it appears at the top or bottom of the
graph, no matter what the actual value on the y\-axis is.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1PREV\s0\fR
.Sp
Pushes an \fIunknown\fR value if this is the first value of a data
set or otherwise the result of this \fB\s-1CDEF\s0\fR at the previous time
step. This allows you to do calculations across the data.  This
function cannot be used in \fB\s-1VDEF\s0\fR instructions.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1PREV\s0(vname)\fR
.Sp
Pushes an \fIunknown\fR value if this is the first value of a data
set or otherwise the result of the vname variable at the previous time
step. This allows you to do calculations across the data. This
function cannot be used in \fB\s-1VDEF\s0\fR instructions.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1COUNT\s0\fR
.Sp
Pushes the number 1 if this is the first value of the data set, the
number 2 if it is the second, and so on. This special value allows
you to make calculations based on the position of the value within
the data set. This function cannot be used in \fB\s-1VDEF\s0\fR instructions.

Time inside RRDtool is measured in seconds since the epoch. The
epoch is defined to be \f(CW\*(C`Thu\ Jan\ 1\ 00:00:00\ UTC\ 1970\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOW\s0\fR

Pushes the current time on the stack.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1TIME\s0\fR
.Sp
Pushes the time the currently processed value was taken at onto the stack.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1LTIME\s0\fR
.Sp
Takes the time as defined by \fB\s-1TIME\s0\fR, applies the time zone offset
valid at that time including daylight saving time if your \s-1OS\s0 supports
it, and pushes the result on the stack.  There is an elaborate example
in the examples section below on how to use this.

Return the corresponding value, \s-1MAXIMUM\s0 and \s-1MINIMUM\s0 also return
the first occurrence of that value in the time component.

Example: \f(CW\*(C`VDEF:avg=mydata,AVERAGE\*(C'\fR
.IP "\s-1LAST\s0, \s-1FIRST\s0" 4
.IX Item "LAST, FIRST"
Return the last/first value including its time.  The time for
\&\s-1FIRST\s0 is actually the start of the corresponding interval, whereas
\&\s-1LAST\s0 returns the end of the corresponding interval.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`VDEF:first=mydata,FIRST\*(C'\fR
.IP "\s-1TOTAL\s0" 4
.IX Item "TOTAL"
Returns the rate from each defined time slot multiplied with the
step size.  This can, for instance, return total bytes transfered
when you have logged bytes per second. The time component returns
the number of seconds.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`VDEF:total=mydata,TOTAL\*(C'\fR
.IP "\s-1PERCENT\s0" 4
.IX Item "PERCENT"
This should follow a \fB\s-1DEF\s0\fR or \fB\s-1CDEF\s0\fR \fIvname\fR. The \fIvname\fR is popped,
another number is popped which is a certain percentage (0..100). The
data set is then sorted and the value returned is chosen such that
\&\fIpercentage\fR percent of the values is lower or equal than the result.
\&\fIUnknown\fR values are considered lower than any finite number for this
purpose so if this operator returns an \fIunknown\fR you have quite a lot
of them in your data.  \fBInf\fRinite numbers are lesser, or more, than the
finite numbers and are always more than the \fIUnknown\fR numbers.
