=head1 NAME

rrdresize - alters the size of an RRA and creates a new .rrd file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rrdtool> B<resize> I<filename> I<rra-num>  B<GROW>I<|>B<SHRINK> I<rows>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<resize> function is used to modify the number of rows in
an B<RRA>.

=over 8

=item I<filename>

the name of the B<RRD> you want to alter.

=item I<rra-num>

the B<RRA> you want to alter. You can find the number using B<rrdtool info>.

=item B<GROW>

used if you want to add extra rows to an RRA. The extra rows will be inserted
as the rows that are oldest.

=item B<SHRINK>

used if you want to remove rows from an RRA. The rows that will be removed
are the oldest rows.

=item I<rows>

the number of rows you want to add or remove.

=back

=head1 NOTES

The new .rrd file, with the modified RRAs, is written to the file
B<resize.rrd> in the current directory.  B<The original .rrd file is not
modified>.

It is possible to abuse this tool and get strange results
by first removing some rows and then reinserting the same amount (effectively
clearing them to be Unknown). You may thus end up with unknown data in one
RRA while at the same timestamp this data is available in another RRA.
