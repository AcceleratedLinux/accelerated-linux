       rrrrddccggii is a sort of very limited script interpreter. Its
       purpose is to run as a cgi-program and parse a web page
       template containing special <RRD:: tags. rrrrddccggii will
       interpret and act according to these tags.  In the end it
       will printout a web page including the necessary CGI head-
       ers.

       rrrrddccggii parses the contents of the template in 3 steps. In
       each step it looks only for a subset of tags. This allows
       nesting of tags.

       The argument parser uses the same semantics as you are
       used from your C-shell.

       ----ffiilltteerr
               Assume that rrdcgi is run as a filter and not as a
               cgi.

       RRD::CV _n_a_m_e
               Inserts the CGI variable of the given name.

       RRD::CV::QUOTE _n_a_m_e
               Inserts the CGI variable of the given name but
               quotes it, ready for use as an argument in another
               RRD:: tag. So even when there are spaces in the
               value of the CGI variable it will still be consid-
               ered to be one argument.

       RRD::CV::PATH _n_a_m_e
               Inserts the CGI variable of the given name, quotes
               it and makes sure it starts neither with a '/' nor
               contains '..'. This is to make sure that no prob-
               lematic pathnames can be introduced through the
               CGI interface.

       RRD::GETENV _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
               Get the value of an environment variable.

                <RRD::GETENV REMOTE_USER>

               might give you the name of the remote user given
               you are using some sort of access control on the
               directory.

       RRD::GOODFOR _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               Specify the number of seconds this page should
               remain valid. This will prompt the rrdcgi to out-
               put a Last-Modified, an Expire and if the number
               of seconds is _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e a Refresh header.

       RRD::INCLUDE _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               Include the contents of the specified file into
               the page returned from the cgi.

       RRD::SETENV _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _v_a_l_u_e
               If you want to present your graphs in another time
               zone than your own, you could use

                <RRD::SETENV TZ UTC>

               to make sure everything is presented in Universal
               Time. Note that the values permitted to TZ depend
               on your OS.

       RRD::SETVAR _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _v_a_l_u_e
               Analog to SETENV but for local variables.

       RRD::GETVAR _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
               Analog to GETENV but for local variables.

       RRD::TIME::LAST _r_r_d_-_f_i_l_e _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
               This gets replaced by the last modification time
               of the selected RRD. The time is _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e-format-
               ted with the string specified in the second argu-
               ment.

       RRD::TIME::NOW _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
               This gets replaced by the current time of day. The
               time is _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e-formatted with the string speci-
               fied in the argument.

               Note that if you return : (colons) from your strf-
               time format you may have to escape them using \ if
               the time is to be used as an argument to a GRAPH
               command.

       RRD::TIME::STRFTIME _S_T_A_R_T_|_E_N_D _s_t_a_r_t_-_s_p_e_c _e_n_d_-_s_p_e_c _s_t_r_f_-
       _t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
               This gets replaced by a strftime-formatted time
               using the format _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t on either _s_t_a_r_t_-
               _s_p_e_c or _e_n_d_-_s_p_e_c depending on whether _S_T_A_R_T or _E_N_D
               is specified.  Both _s_t_a_r_t_-_s_p_e_c and _e_n_d_-_s_p_e_c must
               be supplied as either could be relative to the
               other.  This is intended to allow pretty titles on
               graphs with times that are easier for non RRDtool
               folks to figure out than "-2weeks".

               Note that again, if you return : (colon) from your
               strftime format, you may have to escape them using
               \ if the time is to be used as an argument to a
               GRAPH command.

       RRD::GRAPH _r_r_d_g_r_a_p_h _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
               This tag creates the RRD graph defined by its
               argument and then is replaced by an appropriate
               <IMG ... > tag referring to the graph.  The ----llaazzyy
               option in RRD graph can be used to make sure that
               graphs are only regenerated when they are out of
               date. The arguments to the RRRRDD::::GGRRAAPPHH tag work as
               described in the rrrrddggrraapphh manual page.

               Use the ----llaazzyy option in your RRD::GRAPH tags, to
               reduce the load on your server. This option makes
               sure that graphs are only regenerated when the old
               ones are out of date.

               If you do not specify your own ----iimmggiinnffoo format,
               the following will be used:

                <IMG SRC="%s" WIDTH="%lu" HEIGHT="%lu">

               Note that %s stands for the filename part of the
               graph generated, all directories given in the PNG
               file argument will get dropped.

       RRD::PRINT _n_u_m_b_e_r
               If the preceding  RRRRDD::::GGRRAAPPHH tag contained and
               PPRRIINNTT arguments, then you can access their output
               with this tag. The _n_u_m_b_e_r argument refers to the
               number of the PPRRIINNTT argument. This first PPRRIINNTT has
               _n_u_m_b_e_r 0.

       This script is slightly more elaborate, it allows you to
       run it from a form which sets RRD_NAME. RRD_NAME is then
       used to select which RRD you want to use as source for
       your graph.

       This example shows how to handle the case where the RRD,
       graphs and cgi-bins are seperate directories

       Note 1: Replace /.../ with the relevant directories

       Note 2: The SRC=/.../pngs should be paths from the view of
       the webserver/browser
