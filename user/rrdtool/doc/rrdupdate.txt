       The uuppddaattee function feeds new data values into an RRRRDD. The
       data is time aligned (interpolated) according to the prop-
       erties of the RRRRDD to which the data is written.

       uuppddaatteevv This alternate version of uuppddaattee takes the same
               arguments and performs the same function. The _v
               stands for _v_e_r_b_o_s_e, which describes the output
               returned. uuppddaatteevv returns a list of any and all
               consolidated data points (CDPs) written to disk as
               a result of the invocation of update. The values
               are indexed by timestamp (time_t), RRA (consolida-
               tion function and PDPs per CDP), and data source
               (name).  Note that depending on the arguments of
               the current and previous call to update, the list
               may have no entries or a large number of entries.

       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               The name of the RRRRDD you want to update.

               By default, the uuppddaattee function expects its data
               input in the order the data sources are defined in
               the RRD, excluding any COMPUTE data sources (i.e.
               if the third data source DDSSTT is COMPUTE, the third
               input value will be mapped to the fourth data
               source in the RRRRDD and so on). This is not very
               error resistant, as you might be sending the wrong
               data into an RRD.

               The template switch allows you to specify which
               data sources you are going to update and in which
               order. If the data sources specified in the tem-
               plate are not available in the RRD file, the
               update process will abort with an error message.

               While it appears possible with the template switch
               to update data sources asynchronously, RRRRDDttooooll
               implicitly assigns non-COMPUTE data sources miss-
               ing from the template the _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_* value.

               Do not specify a value for a COMPUTE DDSSTT in the
               uuppddaattee function. If this is done accidentally (and
               this can only be done using the template switch),
               RRRRDDttooooll will ignore the value specified for the
               COMPUTE DDSSTT.

       NN|_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p::_v_a_l_u_e[::_v_a_l_u_e...]
               The data used for updating the RRD was acquired at
               a certain time. This time can either be defined in
               seconds since 1970-01-01 or by using the letter
               'N', in which case the update time is set to be
               the current time. Negative time values are
               subtracted from the current time. An AT_STYLE TIME
               SPECIFICATION (see the _r_r_d_f_e_t_c_h documentation) may
               also be used by delimiting the end of the time
               specification with the '@' character instead of a
               ':'. Getting the timing right to the second is
               especially important when you are working with
               data-sources of type CCOOUUNNTTEERR, DDEERRIIVVEE or AABBSSOOLLUUTTEE.

               The remaining elements of the argument are DS
               updates. The order of this list is the same as the
               order the data sources were defined in the RRA. If
               there is no data for a certain data-source, the
               letter UU (e.g., N:0.1:U:1) can be specified.

               The format of the value acquired from the data
               source is dependent on the data source type cho-
               sen. Normally it will be numeric, but the data
               acquisition modules may impose their very own
               parsing of this parameter as long as the colon (::)
               remains the data source value separator.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       "rrdtool update demo1.rrd N:3.44:3.15:U:23"

       Update the database file demo1.rrd with 3 known and one
       _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_* value. Use the current time as the update time.

       "rrdtool update demo2.rrd 887457267:U 887457521:22
       887457903:2.7"

       Update the database file demo2.rrd which expects data from
       a single data-source, three times. First with an _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_*
       value then with two regular readings. The update interval
       seems to be around 300 seconds.
