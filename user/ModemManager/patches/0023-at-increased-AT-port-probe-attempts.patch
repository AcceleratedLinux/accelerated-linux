ModemManager sometimes didn't receive probe response when
switching from ATT to Verizon FW on LM960. Then, the modem
became inaccessible. ModemManager was probing the AT port
up to 3 times and then marked the AT port unavailable when
no response received.
We saw ModemManger received probe reply at 4th probe on LM960.
