.SH DESCRIPTION
The default signal for kill is TERM. Use -l or -L to list available signals.
Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.
Alternate signals may be specified in three ways: -9 -SIGKILL -KILL.
Negative PID values may be used to choose whole process groups; see the
PGID column in ps command output. A PID of -1 is special; it indicates
all processes except the kill process itself and init.

the conflict.

.SH AUTHOR
Albert Cahalan <albert@users.sf.net> wrote kill in 1999 to replace a
bsdutils one that was not standards compliant. The util-linux one might
also work correctly.
