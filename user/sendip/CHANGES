- tidied up the build for platform specific LDFLAGS
- turned off profiling
- renamed our copy of getopt to gnugetopt
- created types.h with bool, u_int*_t (solaris only), and endianness stuff
* sendip:
- searches for libraries in . as well as installed path
- man page fix (pointed out by Ambar Paul <ambar.paul@wipro.com>)
* tcp.so:
- now supports -tonum to specify arbitrary TCP options
* ipv4.so:
- supports (some) IP options requested by Fabrice MARIE <fabrice@celestix.com>
- only checks a single layer of enclosing headers for IPV4
* bgp.so:
- non-enclosure in TCP is non-fatal
- doesn't segfault on platforms where static variables and .so files don't mix
* rip.so:
- only checks a single layer of enclosing headers for UDP
* icmp.so:
- only checks a single layer of enclosing headers for IPV4/IPV6
- now compiles on platforms which care about alignment

Changes between sendip-2.1 and sendip-2.2
* spec file fixes (Calum Selkirk <cselkirk@panix.com>)
* FreeBSD compile fixes
* Linux-PPC compile fixes
* More SunOS compile fixes
* Use ?= not = in Makefile to allow FreeBSD ports to work without a hack
  (Joseph Scott <joseph.scott@owp.csus.edu>) 
* Added support for RIPng over UDP/IPv6.  Completely untested, I haven't even
  read the spec... Requested by armite <armite@163.com>
* CheckSum code tidied up
* tcp.so:
- now supports sending TCP over IPv6
- tcp length correctly calculated (pointed out by
  Yuchung Cheng <ycheng@cs.ucsd.edu>)
* udp.so:
- now supports sending UDP over IPv6
- only checks a single layer of enclosing headers for IP
* ipv6.so:
- now correctly sets src and dst fields (Pekka Savola <pekkas@netcore.fi>)
* ipv4.so:
- ip_len now in host byte order on FreeBSD to avoid sendto: Invalid argument
* rip.so:
- off-by-one error causing segfaults and other badness fixed
- hton* added where needed

Changes between sendip-2.2 and sendip-2.3
* Now compiles on archs requiring alignment
* ripng.so:
- now conforms more closely to the spec (help from armite <armite@163.com>

Changes between sendip-2.3 and sendip-2.4
* Random packet data payloads (Anand (Andy) Rao <andyrao@nortelnetworks.com>)
* ipv4.so:
- fix bug with iossr and iolsr adding wrong ip options
- ip_len really is now in host byte order on FreeBSD, so the sendto: Invalid
  argument thing really is fixed now.  I hope.  (brdraney@nersc.gov)

Changes between sendip-2.4 and sendip-2.5
* Fix minor memory leaks in several places (found using valgrind)
