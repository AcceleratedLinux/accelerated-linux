.TH DNSMASQ 8
.SH NAME
dnsmasq \- A caching DNS forwarder.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnsmasq
.I [OPTION]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR dnsmasq
is a lightweight DNS forwarder. 
It accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local,
cache or forwards them to a real, recursive, DNS server. It loads the
contents of /etc/hosts into the cache at startup so that local hostnames
which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved. It can also read hostnames from 
a DHCP leases file so that local hosts which have addresses allocated by DHCP can be named.
.PP
.BR dnsmasq 
supports IPv6.
.PP
.BR dnsmasq
is lightweight and easy to configure. It is intended as be run on
small router/firewalls and  provide a DNS service to a LAN.
.SH OPTIONS
Note that in general missing parameters are allowed and switch off
functions, for instance "--pid-file=" disables writing a PID file.
.TP
.B \-h, --no-hosts
Don't read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.
.TP
.B \-H, --addn-hosts=<file>
Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts. If -h is given, read
only the specified file. At most one additional hosts file may be
given.
.TP
.B \-T, --local-ttl=<time>
When replying with information from /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases
file dnsmasq by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning
that the requestor should not itself cache the information. This is
the correct thing to do in almost all situations. This option allows a
time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies. This will
reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale
data under some circumstances.
.TP
.B \-d, --no-daemon
Debug mode: don't fork to the background, don't write a pid file,
don't change user id, generate a complete cache dump on receipt on
SIGUSR1, log to stderr as well as syslog.
.TP
.B \-q, --log-queries
Log the results of DNS queries handled by dnsmasq. Enable a full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1.
.TP
.B \-x, --pid-file=<path>
Specify an alternate path for dnsmasq to record its process-id in. Normally /var/run/dnsmasq.pid.
.TP
.B \-u, --user=<username>
Specify the userid to which dnsmasq will change after startup. Dnsmasq must normally be started as root, but it will drop root 
priviledges after startup by changing id to another user. Normally this user is "nobody" but that 
can be over-ridden with this switch.
.TP
.B \-g, --group=<groupname> 
Specify the group which dnsmasq will run
as. The defaults to "dip", if available, to facilitate access to
/etc/ppp/resolv.conf which is not normally world readable.
.TP
.B \-v, --version
Print the version number.
.TP
.B \-p, --port=<port>
Listen on <port> instead of the standard DNS port (53). Useful mainly for
debugging.
.TP
.B \-Q, --query-port=<query_port>
Send outbound DNS queries from, and listen for their replies on, the specific UDP port <query_port> instead of using one chosen at runtime.  Useful to simplify your
firewall rules; without this, your firewall would have to allow connections from outside DNS servers to a range of UDP ports, or dynamically adapt to the
port being used by the current dnsmasq instance.
.TP
.B \-i, --interface=<interface name>
Listen only on the specified interface. More than one interface may be specified. Dnsmasq always listens on the loopback (local) interface. If no
.B \-i
flags are given, dnsmasq listens on all available interfaces unless overridden by 
.B \-a
or
.B \-I
flags.
.TP
.B \-I, --except-interface=<interface name>
Do not listen on the specified interface.
.TP 
.B \-a, --listen-address
Listen only on the given IP address. As with 
.B \-i
more than one address may be specified. Unlike 
.B \-i
the loopback interface is not special: if dnsmasq is to listen on the loopback interface, 
it's IP, 127.0.0.1, must be explicitly given. If no 
.B \-a
flags are given, dnsmasq listens on all available interfaces unless overridden by 
.B \-i
or
.B \-I
flags.
.TP
.B \-b, --bogus-priv
Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc)
which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file are resolved to the IP address in dotted-quad form.
.TP
.B \-B, --bogus-nxdomain=<ipaddr>
Transform replies which contain the IP address given into "No such
domain" replies. This is intended to counteract a devious move made by
Versign in September 2003 when they started returning the address of
an advertising web page in response to queries for unregistered names,
instead of the correct NXDOMAIN response. This option tells dnsmasq to
fake the correct response when it sees this behaviour. As at Sept 2003
the IP address being returnd by Verisign is 64.94.110.11
.TP
.B \-f, --filterwin2k
Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which don't get sensible answers from
the public DNS and can cause problems by triggering dial-on-demand links. This flag turns on an option
to filter such requests. The requests blocked are for records of types SOA and SRV, and type ANY where the 
requested name has underscores, to catch LDAP requests.
.TP
.B \-r, --resolv-file=<file>
Read the IP addresses of the upstream nameservers from <file>, instead of
/etc/resolv.conf. For the format of this file see
.BR resolv.conf (5) 
the only lines relevant to dnsmasq are nameserver ones. Dnsmasq can
be told to poll more than one resolv.conf file, the first file name  specified
overrides the default, subsequent ones add to the list. This is only
allowed when polling; the file with the currently latest modification
time is the one used. 
.TP
.B \-R, --no-resolv
Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command
line or /etc/dnsmasq.conf.
.TP
.B \-o, --strict-order
By default, dnsmasq will send queries to any of the upstream servers
it knows about and tries to favour servers to are known to
be up. Setting this flag forces dnsmasq to try each query with each
server strictly in the order they appear in /etc/resolv.conf
.TP
.B \-n, --no-poll
Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.
.TP
.B \-D, --domain-needed
Tells dnsmasq to never forward queries for plain names, without dots
or domain parts, to upstream nameservers. If the name is not knowm
from /etc/hosts or DHCP then a "not found" answer is returned.
.TP
.B \-S, --server=[/[<domain>]/[domain/]][<ipaddr>[#<port>][@<source>[#<port>]]]
Specify IP address of upsream severs directly. Setting this flag does
not suppress reading of /etc/resolv.conf, use -R to do that. If one or
more 
optional domains are given, that server is used only for those domains
and they are queried only using the specified server. This is
intended for private nameservers: if you have a nameserver on your
network which deals with names of the form
xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk at 192.168.1.1 then giving  the flag 
.B -S /internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1 
will send all queries for
internal machines to that nameserver, everything else will go to the
servers in /etc/resolv.conf. An empty domain specification,
.B // 
has the special meaning of "unqualified names only" ie names without any
dots in them. A non-standard port may be specified as 
part of the IP
address using a # character.
More than one -S flag is allowed, with
repeated domain or ipaddr parts as required. 

Also permitted is a -S
flag which gives a domain but no IP address; this tells dnsmasq that
a domain is local and it may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP
but should never forward queries on that domain to any upstream
servers.
.B local
is a synonym for
.B server
to make configuration files clearer in this case.

The optional second IP address after the @ character tells
dnsmasq how to set the source address of the queries to this
nameserver. It should be an address belonging to the machine on which
dnsmasq is running otherwise this server line will be logged and then
ignored. The query-port flag is ignored for any servers which have a
source address specified but the port may be specified directly as
part of the source address.
.TP
.B \-A, --address=/<domain>/[domain/]<ipaddr>
Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains.
Queries in the domains are never forwarded and always replied to
with the specified IP address which may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a domain, use repeated -A flags.
Note that /etc/hosts and DHCP leases override this for individual
names. A common use of this is to redirect the entire doubleclick.net
domain to some friendly local web server to avoid banner ads.
.TP
.B \-m, --mx-host=<mx name>
Return an MX record named <mx name> pointing to the host specified in the --mx-target switch
or, if that switch is not given, the host on which dnsmasq 
is running. This is useful for directing mail from systems on a LAN
to a central server.
.TP 
.B \-t, --mx-target=<hostname>
Specify target for the MX record returned by dnsmasq. See --mx-host. Note that to turn on the MX function, 
at least one of --mx-host and --mx-target must be set. If only one of --mx-host and --mx-target 
is set, the other defaults to the hostname of the machine on which dnsmasq is running.
.TP
.B \-e, --selfmx
Return an MX record pointing to itself for each local
machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases
file.
.TP 
.B \-L, --localmx
Return an MX record pointing to the host given by mx-target (or the
machine on which dnsmasq is running) for each
local machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts or the DHCP
leases file.
.TP
.B \-c, --cache-size=<cachesize>
Set the size of dnsmasq's cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the cache size to zero disables caching.
.TP
.B \-N, --no-negcache
Disable negative caching. Negative caching allows dnsmasq to remember
"no such domain" answers from upstream nameservers and answer
identical queries without forwarding them again. This flag disables
negative caching.
.TP
.B \-l, --dhcp-lease=<path>
Read DHCP leases from the specified lease file. The file is of the format created by the ISC dhcp daemon: see
.BR dhcpd.leases (5)
for details. Dnsmasq will re-read the file as it changes. Any host which sets the "hostname" or "client-hostname" option will have that name inserted into dnsmasq's cache.
.TP
.B \-s, --domain-suffix=<domain>
Specifies the domain which hosts read from the DHCP leases file must have to be legal. The intention is to constrain hostnames so that an untrusted host on the LAN cannot advertise it's name via dhcp as e.g. "microsoft.com" and capture traffic not meant for it. If no domain suffix is specified, then any DHCP hostname with a domain part (ie with a period) will be disallowed and logged. If suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain part are allowed, provided the domain part matches the suffix. In addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames without a domain part have the suffix added as an optional domain part. Eg on my network I can set 
.B --domain-suffix=thekelleys.org.uk
and have a machine whose DHCP hostname is "laptop". The IP address for that machine is available from 
.B dnsmasq
both as "laptop" and "laptop.thekelleys.org.uk".
.TP
.B \-E, --expand-hosts
Add the domain-suffix to simple names (without a period) in /etc/hosts
in the same way as for DHCP-derived names.
.SH CONFIG FILE
At startup, dnsmasq reads /etc/dnsmasq.conf, if it exists. The format of this
file consists of one option per line, exactly as the long options detailed 
in the OPTIONS section. Lines starting with # are comments and ignored. For
options which may only be specified once, /etc/dnsmasq.conf overrides 
the command line. Use the --conf-file option to specify a different
configuration file.
.SH NOTES
When it receives a SIGHUP, 
.B dnsmasq 
clears its cache and then re-loads /etc/hosts. If 
.B
--no-poll
is set SIGHUP also re-reads /etc/resolv.conf. SIGHUP
does NOT re-read /etc/dnsmasq.conf.
.PP
When it receives a SIGUSR1,
.B dnsmasq 
writes cache statistics to the system log. It writes the cache size, the number of names which have had to removed from the cache before they expired in order to make room for new names and the total number of names have been inserted into the cache. In 
.B --no-daemon
mode or when full logging is enabled (-q), a complete dump of the contents of the cache is made.
.PP
When it receives a SIGUSR2,
.B dnsmasq
re-scans network interfaces. This is required if it is to listen for
queries on newly created interfaces or interfaces which have changed IP
address. For this facility to work, dnsmasq must be told to continue
running as user root, using 
.B --user=root
.PP
Dnsmasq is a DNS query forwarder: it it not capable of recursively
answering arbitrary queries starting from the root servers but
forwards such queries to a fully recursive upstream DNS server which is
typically provided by an ISP. By default, dnsmasq reads
/etc/resolv.conf to discover the IP
addresses of the upstream nameservers it should use, since the
information is typically stored there. Unless
.B --no-poll
is used,
.B dnsmasq
checks the modification time of /etc/resolv.conf (or 
equivalent if 
.B \--resolv-file 
is used) and re-reads it if it changes. This allows the DNS servers to
be set dynamically by PPP or DHCP since both protocols provide the
information.
Absence of /etc/resolv.conf is not an error
since it may not have been created before a PPP connection exists. Dnsmasq 
simply keeps checking in case /etc/resolv.conf is created at any
time. Dnsmasq can be told to parse more than one resolv.conf
file. This is useful on a laptop, where both PPP and DHCP may be used:
dnsmasq can be set to poll both /etc/ppp/resolv.conf and
/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf and will use the contents of whichever changed
last, giving automatic switching between DNS servers.
.PP
Upstream servers may also be specified on the command line or in
/etc/dnsmasq.conf. These server specifications optionally take a
domain name which tells dnsmasq to use that server only to find names
in that particular domain.
.PP
In order to configure dnsmasq to act as cache for the host on which it is running, put "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in
.I /etc/resolv.conf
to force local processes to send queries to
dnsmasq. Then either specify the upstream servers directly to dnsmasq
using 
.B \--server
options or put their addresses real in another file, say
.I /etc/resolv.dnsmasq
and run dnsmasq with the 
.B \-r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq
option. This second technique allows for dynamic update of the server
addresses by PPP or DHCP.
