Installation:
=============

Run configure, e.g.

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc --mandir=/usr/share/man

The configure script will now try to guess where your IPv6 libraries and
include files are if you don't specify them explicitly via LDFLAGS or
CPPFLAGS respectively. Currently it will search in /usr/inet6/(include|lib)
and /usr/ipv6/(include|lib). If separate IPv6 libraries are not necessary
for your system, like recent Linux distributions, you will not need to
specify this option. You still have to use the --prefix option to specify
the install tree though. The default prefix is /usr/local.

See configure --help for additional command line arguments.

Run make and make install.
