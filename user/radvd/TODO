read list of interfaces with SIOCGIFCONF (AF_INET6 support in the kernel would
be nice) or from /proc

follow interface state via netlink interface and send RAs only when the
interface is up

use getaddrinfo() instead of inet_pton in scanner.l so that DNS names
can be used

Quoting Peter Bieringer (peter@bieringer.de):

[ Peter wants that a debugging level greater than 0 doesn't stop radvd
from forking.]

support for few protocol constants defined in RFC 2461 Sec 10 is missing.

consider whether it's worth integrating radvdump print_ff and print_ra
functions as they provide very similar service and there's some code
duplication.

consider whether UnicastOnly flag should be detected by radvdump.

read the man pages one more time and make sure their are understandable
and English is correct
