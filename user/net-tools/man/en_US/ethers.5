The two items are separated by any number of SPACE and/or TAB char
acters.   A \fB#\fP at the beginning of a line starts a comment

written as
.IR x : x : x : x : x : x ,
where \fIx\fP is a hexadecimal number between \fB0\fP and \fBff\fP
which represents one byte of the address, which is in network byte
order (big-endian).  The \fIIP-number\fP may be a hostname which
can be resolved by DNS or a dot separated number.
