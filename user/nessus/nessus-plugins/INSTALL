Before you install nessus-plugins, the packages 'nessus-libraries', 'libnasl'
and 'nessus-core' should be installed on your system. Make sure that the 
program 'nessus-config' is in your path, or else you won't be able to 
compile the plugins. 'nessus-config' is installed in /usr/local/bin.

The compilation of nessus-plugins is straightforward :

	./configure
	make

and then as root :

	make install
