The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-1125 (gpdf).

This is GPdf, a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files for
GNOME. GPdf is based on the Xpdf program and uses additional GNOME
libraries for better desktop integration.

GPdf includes the gpdf application, a Bonobo control for PDF display
which can be embedded in Nautilus, and a Nautilus property page for
PDF files.

Update Information:

Several flaws were discovered in Xpdf, which is used
internally by gpdf. An attacker could
construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause gpdf
to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the
name CAN-2005-3193 to these issues.

Users of gpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a patch to resolve these issues.
