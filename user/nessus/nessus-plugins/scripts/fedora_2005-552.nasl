The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-552 (krb5).

Kerberos V5 is a trusted-third-party network authentication system,
which can improve your network's security by eliminating the insecure
practice of cleartext passwords.

Update Information:

A double-free flaw was found in the krb5_recvauth() routine which may
be triggered by a remote unauthenticated attacker. Fedora Core 3
contains checks within glibc that detect double-free flaws. Therefore,
on Fedora Core 3, successful exploitation of this issue can only lead
to a denial of service (KDC crash). The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-1689 to this issue.

Daniel Wachdorf discovered a single byte heap overflow in the
krb5_unparse_name() function, part of krb5-libs. Successful
exploitation of this flaw would lead to a denial of service (crash).
To trigger this flaw remotely, an attacker would need to have control
of a kerberos realm that shares a cross-realm key with the target,
making exploitation of this flaw unlikely. (CVE-2005-1175).

Daniel Wachdorf also discovered that in error conditions that may
occur in response to correctly-formatted client requests, the Kerberos
5 KDC may attempt to free uninitialized memory. This could allow a
remote attacker to cause a denial of service (KDC crash)
(CVE-2005-1174).

GaÃ«l Delalleau discovered an information disclosure issue in the way
some telnet clients handle messages from a server. An attacker could
construct a malicious telnet server that collects information from the
environment of any victim who connects to it using the Kerberos-aware
telnet client (CVE-2005-0488).

The rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to
arbitrary files outside of the current directory. This could
potentially cause a security issue if a user uses the Kerberos-aware
rcp to copy files from a malicious server (CVE-2004-0175).
