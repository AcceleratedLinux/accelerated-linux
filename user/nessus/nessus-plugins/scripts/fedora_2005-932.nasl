The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-932 (mozilla).

Mozilla is an open-source web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance and portability.

Update Information:

Updated mozilla packages that fix several security bugs are
now available for Fedora Core 3.

This update has been rated as having critical security
impact by the Fedora Security Response Team.

Mozilla is an open source Web browser, advanced email and
newsgroup client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

A bug was found in the way Mozilla processes XBM image
files. If a user views a specially crafted XBM file, it
becomes possible to execute arbitrary code as the user
running Mozilla. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-2701
to this issue.

A bug was found in the way Mozilla processes certain Unicode
sequences. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code as
the user running Mozilla, if the user views a specially
crafted Unicode sequence. (CVE-2005-2702)

A bug was found in the way Mozilla makes XMLHttp requests.
It is possible that a malicious web page could leverage this
flaw to exploit other proxy or server flaws from the
victim's machine. It is also possible that this flaw could
be leveraged to send XMLHttp requests to hosts other than
the originator; the default behavior of the browser is to
disallow this. (CVE-2005-2703)

A bug was found in the way Mozilla implemented its XBL
interface. It may be possible for a malicious web page to
create an XBL binding in a way that would allow arbitrary
JavaScript execution with chrome permissions. Please note
that in Mozilla 1.7.10 this issue is not directly
exploitable and would need to leverage other unknown
exploits. (CVE-2005-2704)

An integer overflow bug was found in Mozilla's JavaScript
engine. Under favorable conditions, it may be possible for a
malicious web page to execute arbitrary code as the user
running Mozilla. (CVE-2005-2705)

A bug was found in the way Mozilla displays about: pages. It
is possible for a malicious web page to open an about: page,
such as about:mozilla, in such a way that it becomes
possible to execute JavaScript with chrome privileges.
(CVE-2005-2706)

A bug was found in the way Mozilla opens new windows. It is
possible for a malicious web site to construct a new window
without any user interface components, such as the address
bar and the status bar. This window could then be used to
mislead the user for malicious purposes. (CVE-2005-2707)

Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this updated
package that contains Mozilla version 1.7.12 and is not
vulnerable to these issues.
