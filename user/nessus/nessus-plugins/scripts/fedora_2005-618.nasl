The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-618 (devhelp).

A API document browser for GNOME 2.

Update Information:

Devhelp is an API document browser for the GNOME environment.

There were several security flaws found in the mozilla package, which
devhelp depends on.
Users of devhelp are advised to upgrade to this updated package which
has been rebuilt
against a version of mozilla not vulnerable to these flaws.
