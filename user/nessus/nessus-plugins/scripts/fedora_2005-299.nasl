The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-299 (gaim).

Gaim allows you to talk to anyone using a variety of messaging
protocols, including AIM (Oscar and TOC), ICQ, IRC, Yahoo!,
MSN Messenger, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Napster, and Zephyr.  These
protocols are implemented using a modular, easy to use design.
To use a protocol, just add an account using the account editor.

Gaim supports many common features of other clients, as well as many
unique features, such as perl scripting and C plugins.

Gaim is NOT affiliated with or endorsed by America Online, Inc.,
Microsoft Corporation, or Yahoo! Inc. or other messaging service
providers.
