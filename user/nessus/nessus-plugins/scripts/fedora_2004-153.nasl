The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2004-153 (ethereal).

Ethereal is a network traffic analyzer for Unix-ish operating systems.

This package lays base for libpcap, a packet capture and filtering
library, contains command-line utilities, contains plugins and
documentation for ethereal. A graphical user interface is packaged
separately to GTK+ package.

Update Information:

 Issues have been discovered in the following protocol dissectors:

    * A SIP packet could make Ethereal crash under specific conditions,
as described in the following message:
      http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-users/200405/msg00018.html
      (0.10.3).
    * The AIM dissector could throw an assertion, causing Ethereal to
terminate abnormally (0.10.3).
    * It was possible for the SPNEGO dissector to dereference a null
pointer, causing a crash (0.9.8 to 0.10.3).
    * The MMSE dissector was susceptible to a buffer overflow. (0.10.1
to 0.10.3).

All users of the Ethereal package are strongly encouraged to update to these
latest packages.
