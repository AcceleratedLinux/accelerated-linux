  An updated RealPlayer package that fixes a buffer overflow issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  RealPlayer is a media player that provides solid media playback locally
  and via streaming. It plays RealAudio, RealVideo, MP3, 3GPP Video,
  Flash, SMIL 2.0, JPEG, GIF, PNG, RealPix and RealText and
  more.

  A buffer overflow bug was found in the way RealPlayer processes RAM files.
  An attacker could create a specially crafted RAM file which could execute
  arbitrary code when opened by a user. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-0755 to
  this issue.

  All users of RealPlayer are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains RealPlayer version 10.0.4 and is not vulnerable to this
  issue.
