The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-952 (w3c-libwww).

Libwww is a general-purpose Web API written in C for Unix and Windows (Win32).
With a highly extensible and layered API, it can accommodate many different
types of applications including clients, robots, etc. The purpose of libwww
is to provide a highly optimized HTTP sample implementation as well as other
Internet protocols and to serve as a testbed for protocol experiments.

Update Information:

This update fixes libwww's handling of multipart/byteranges
content and a possible stack overflow.


Solution : Get the newest Fedora Updates
