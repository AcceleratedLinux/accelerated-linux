The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-908 (cups).

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
UNIXÂ® operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products
to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.
CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

Update Information:

A bug was found in the way CUPS processes malformed HTTP
requests. It is possible for a remote user capable of
connecting to the CUPS daemon to issue a malformed HTTP GET
request which will cause CUPS to enter an infinite loop.
This is CVE-2005-2874.
