The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2005-1121 (xpdf).

Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format
(PDF) files. Xpdf is a small and efficient program which uses
standard X fonts.

Update Information:

Several flaws were discovered in Xpdf. An attacker could
construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause Xpdf
to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the
name CAN-2005-3193 to these issues.

Users of Xpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a patch to resolve these issues.



Solution : Get the newest Fedora Updates
Risk factor : High";
