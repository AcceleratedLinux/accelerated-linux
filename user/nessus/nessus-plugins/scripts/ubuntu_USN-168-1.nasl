Synopsis :

These remote packages are missing security patches :
- gaim 
- gaim-data 
- gaim-dev 


Description :

Daniel Atallah discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the
file transfer handler of OSCAR (the module that handles various
instant messaging protocols like ICQ). A remote attacker could crash
the Gaim client of an user by attempting to send him a file with
a name that contains invalid UTF-8 characters. (CVE-2005-2102)

It was found that specially crafted "away" messages triggered a buffer
overflow. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the Gaim
client or possibly even execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the Gaim user. (CVE-2005-2103)

Szymon Zygmunt and Micha≈Ç Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment
error in the Gadu library, which was fixed in USN-162-1. However, it
was discovered that Gaim contains a copy of the vulnerable code. By
sending specially crafted messages over the Gadu protocol, a remote
attacker could crash Gaim. (CVE-2005-2370)

Solution :

Upgrade to : 
- gaim-1.1.4-1ubuntu4.4 (Ubuntu 5.04)
- gaim-data-1.1.4-1ubuntu4.4 (Ubuntu 5.04)
- gaim-dev-1.1.4-1ubuntu4.4 (Ubuntu 5.04)
