The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory FEDORA-2004-584 (tetex).

TeTeX is an implementation of TeX for Linux or UNIX systems. TeX takes
a text file and a set of formatting commands as input and creates a
typesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file as output.
Usually, TeX is used in conjunction with a higher level formatting
package like LaTeX or PlainTeX, since TeX by itself is not very
user-friendly.

Install tetex if you want to use the TeX text formatting system. If
you are installing tetex, you will also need to install tetex-afm (a
PostScript(TM) font converter for TeX),
tetex-dvips (for converting .dvi files to PostScript format
for printing on PostScript printers), tetex-latex (a higher level
formatting package which provides an easier-to-use interface for TeX),
and tetex-xdvi (for previewing .dvi files in X). Unless you are an
expert at using TeX, you should also install the tetex-doc package,
which includes the documentation for TeX.

Update Information:

The updated tetex package fixes a buffer overflow which allows
attackers
to cause the internal xpdf library used by applications in tetex to
crash,
and possibly to execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures projects (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-1125
to this issue.
