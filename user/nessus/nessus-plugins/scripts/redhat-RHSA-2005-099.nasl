  An updated Squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat
  Security Response Team.

  SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.

  Jimmy Conner discovered a missing variable initialization in Squirrelmail.
  This flaw could allow potential insecure file inclusions on servers where
  the PHP setting "register_globals" is set to "On". This is not a default or
  recommended setting. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-0075 to this issue.

  A URL sanitisation bug was found in Squirrelmail. This flaw could allow a
  cross site scripting attack when loading the URL for the sidebar. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CVE-2005-0103 to this issue.

  which contains backported patches to correct these issues.
