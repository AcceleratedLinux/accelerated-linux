Note to the *BSD users. 


Nessus uses the pcap library, which uses the
berkeley packet filter (bpf) to do its job.

Since Nessus used multiple processes, several pcap-aware plugins will
need to access the the bpf at the same time. 

This means that you need to recompile your kernel with the
following option :

pseudo-device   bpfilter NUM

(or pseudo-device bpf NUM)

Where 'NUM' is the number of bpf you want -- it should be equal to
the 'max hosts number' option you enter in nessusd x the
'max plugins' option.
	   
If for instance you want to have 10 nessusd running at the same time,
each running 5 plugins in parallel, you should create 50 (10 * 5) bpfs
(as nessusd is extremely lightweight, you can expect to have this amount
 of processes running at the same time)

If you plan to scan a whole network, we recommand you create at least
100 of them.

Once your kernel has been rebuilt, get root, cd to /dev
and do  :

  i=0; while [ $i -lt 100];
  do
  ./MAKEDEV bpf$i
  let i=$i+1
  done

On FreeBSD, you can directly do :
      ./MAKEDEV bpf+100


If you can not recompile your kernel, you can try to run the configure
script with the option --enable-bpf-sharing. In this case, nessusd will
try to share one /dev/bpf among multiple processes and do the filtering
in userland. NOTE THAT THIS OPTION IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND WE DO 
NOT RECOMMAND ENABLING IT.
