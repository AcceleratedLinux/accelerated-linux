Instruction for the compilation and installation of Nessus-1.0 and later


0. Pre-installation requirements

 
 If you have another version of Nessus, then use the script
 'uninstall-nessus' before you type make.
					
 Make sure that you have bison and flex installed. If you only
 have yacc and lex, you *may* run into problems.


 The basic way to install nessus-libraries is to do :

 	./configure
	make
	make install
 				
  

1. configure options

  All the configure options have been centralized the the 
  'configure' script of nessus-libraries. 
  
  For instance, if you want to disable the cipher layer,
  then just type :

    	./configure --disable-cipher
	
  This will affect the build of the other packages, as
  the 'configure' options are then hardcoded in the 
  nessus library.
  
  The current configure options are :
  
  	--enable-cipher[=NN]  enables the compilation of the cipher
                              layer with a special option: NN is the
           		      size of the keys (use this for US export.)

        --disable-ptmx        use this directive if you have problems
                              with the pseudo tty multiplexer; on 
                              some linux (kernel > 2.2) systems, the
                              /dev/ptmx is avaiable but the supporting
                              functions sometimes do not work as
                              expected

        --enable-zlib=peks    explicitely configure and compile the
			      data stream compression package against
                              the source fragment that comes with peks,
	                      even if the operating system provides
			      it as a library

        --enable-gmp=peks     explicitely configure and compile the
			      maths package against the source fragment
			      that comes with peks, even if the operating
		              system provides it as a library

        --enable-splitgmp     split off the gmp library that comes with the
			      peks sources from the cipher lib, and provide
			      a sepatate library instance: this flag is
			      needed only if the assembler part of the gmp
		  	      lib should not be used as a shared library,
			      while the libpeks, is.

  Some more elaborate options allow you to control whether to compile and
  link against the packages that come with peks, or to use resources from
  your operating system.

        --enable-zlib[=/path]  do not use the package provided with
                               peks, but the one already installed

        --enable-gmp[=/path]   do not use the package provided with
                               peks, but the one already installed

        --enable-random[=/dev] use this device as an additional random
                               source; you may need to set this explicitlely
			       on systems other than Linux and BSD where
                               there is a character device /dev/urandom
                               available (other device names will not be 
			       auto-detected.)

2. Compilation and installation


Compilation and installation is done by typing 'make'. If you are running
under Solaris, then add /usr/ccs/bin to your path before you compile :

	make

Then, as root, type :

	make install


3. Files location

  Nessus is installed in the following directories :
  
  	${prefix}/share/nessus       : users database, users keys
	${prefix}/etc/nessusd.conf   : nessusd configuration file
	${prefix}/lib/nessus/        : scripts and plugins
