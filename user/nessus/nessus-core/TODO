What must be done :		(feel free to volunteer)


  On the server side :

  	- replace the arglists by harglists. That is, replace linked 
	  lists by hashtables. All the functions are here, it's just
	  a matter of search/replace thing. 
	  Read /usr/local/include/nessus/harglsts.h for details
	  about the harglsts

	- memory leaks in plugins reload
	  
  On the client side :

	- replace arglists by harglists too. 

  	- Closed report windows don't free the mem

  	- Bug in the gtk list for hosts, ports, it doesn't scrolls
          when too much items displayed. (fixed an arbitrary limit
	  of 500 items).

  	- Bug in html_graph_output, not all services are shown in the graph.

  	- Bug in the script selection, if only one script out of many
  	  is selected and the script_category wasn't once selected it
  	  will not be started.

	- In the plugin list, show the plugins dependencies. This is not
	  easy as it forces us to add some field in the communication
	  between nessusd and nessus. However, the user should know that
	  by deactivating a plugin, he will possibly break something.
