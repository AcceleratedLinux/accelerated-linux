   -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
  To compile the nessus client on windows nt/95 you must prepare the
  package on a unix machine like

     ./configure
     make win32

  After that, you can copy the package to a windows box (perferrably
  you have Samba available, so you can use a shared drive.)

  As a prerequisite you need the nessus-library package installed
  on your windows box as well as the gtk tree.  Usually, the
  nessus-library is installed at a standard place whereas the gtk
  stuff just hangs around.  So you may need to adjust the file
  nmake.w32. Set the parameter GTKROOT to whatever your root of
  the gtk directory is.

  On the windows box, type

     nmake.bat distclean
     nmake.bat all

  and
    
     nmake.bat install
     
  or just "nmake" and see what happens. With a VC++5.0 or VC++6 M$
  compiler you should have no problems, compiling ths stuff.

  If you want some experimetal features supported, use nmakexp.bat
  instead of nmake.bat (just have a look at what the difference is.)

  Finally, you should copy all dlls found in the gtk directories to
  the directory wherever the nessus client is installed. The standard
  place is something like C:\Nessus\bin.

  Now, cd to that directory, type nessus and have fun.
