.SH NAME
nessus-mkrand \- Creates a file with random bytes
.sp
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI nessus-mkrand\ [\| filename\  [\| entropy \|]\ ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The 
.B Nessus Security Scanner
protects the communication between the client and the server by using SSL. 
To work securely, the OpenSSL library needs a suitable amount of random bytes. 
On most system, it uses EGD or 
.I /dev/random 
(or 
.IR /dev/urandom ). 

On systems which have none of these, Nessus will provide OpenSSL with a file 
full of random bytes generated by 
.B nessus-mkrand 
which is stored by default under 
.IR $HOME/.rnd .
.B nessus-mkcert
and
.B nessus-mkcert-client
require user input as a random seed.

By default, 
.B nessus-mkrand 
produces a file stored under 
.I $HOME/.rnd 
containing 1024 bytes of entropy.
