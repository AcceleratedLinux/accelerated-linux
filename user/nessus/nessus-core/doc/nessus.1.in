.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B Nessus Security Scanner
is a security auditing tool made up of two parts: a server, and a client.
The server,
.B nessusd
is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client
.B nessus
provides an interface to the user.

.B nessus 
is an X11 client based on the Gimp ToolKit (GTK).

This man page explains how to use the client.

more files are displayed.

.TP
.BI "-T " <type> ", --output-type=" <type>"
Save the data as <type>, where <type> can be \*(lqnbe\*(rq, \*(lqhtml\*(rq,
\*(lqhtml_graph\*(rq, \*(lqtext\*(rq, \*(lqxml\*(rq, \*(lqold-xml\*(rq,
\*(lqtex\*(rq or \*(lqnsr\*(rq

.TP
.B "-V, --verbose"
make the batch mode display status messages to the screen.

.TP

.SH The X11 interface

The nessus client interface is divided in several panels:
.IP "\(bu The \*(lqNessusd host\*(rq section: "
In this section, you must enter the 
.B nessusd 
host to whom you will connect, as well as the port. You must also enter your 
.B nessusd 
user name and your password (not the one of the system). Once you are done, you
must click on the \*(lqLog in\*(rq button, which will establish the 
connection to the
.B nessusd 
host.
.br
Once the connection is established, 
.B nessusd
sends to the client the list of attacks it will perform, as well as the
default preferences to use.

.IP "\(bu The \*(lqTarget Selection\*(rq section: "
\(bu In this section, you are required to enter the primary target. A 
primary target
may be a single host (e.g. prof.fr.nessus.org), an IP (e.g. 192.168.1.1), a
subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.1/24 or prof.fr.nessus.org), or a list of hosts, 
separated by commas (e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1/24, prof.fr.nessus.org, 
joyeux.fr.nessus.org).
.br


\(bu You can restrict the maximum number of hosts to test using the 
\*(lqMax Hosts\*(rq entry.
This is a feature that prevents you from scanning too many machines;
or accidentally scanning other machines.
(For instance, if you only plan to test prof.fr.nessus.org and
www.fr.nessus.org, you can safely set this entry to \*(lq2\*(rq).
.br


\(bu This panel also allows you to enable the \*(lqPerform a DNS zone 
transfer\*(rq
option. This option is dangerous and should be enabled with caution. 
For instance, if you want to test www.nessus.org, then if this option is set,
.B nessusd 
will attempt to get the list of the hosts in the \*(lqnessus.org\*(rq
domain.

This option may be dangerous. For instance, if you enable it and you ask to
test 192.168.1.1/24, then
.B nessusd 
will do a reverse lookup on 
.I every
IP, and will attempt a DNS zone transfer on every domain. That is, if 
192.168.1.1 is www.foo.bar, and 192.168.1.10 is mail.bar.foo, then
a DNS zone transfer will be made on the domains \*(lqfoo.bar\*(rq 
and \*(lqbar.foo\*(rq. 


.IP "\(bu The \*(lqPlugins\*(rq section"
Once you have successfully logged into the remote 
.B nessusd 
server,
this section is filed with the list of the attacks that the server will
perform. This panel is divided in two parts: the plugins families, and
the plugins themselves. If you click on the name of a plugin, then
a dialog will appear, showing you which will be the error message
sent by the plugin if the attack is successful.

.SH Report conversion
.P
You can use
.B nessus
to do conversion between formats used for reports. Nessus can take
any NSR or NBE reports and change them into HTML, XML, NSR or NBE reports.
.P
Please note that the XML report provides usually more information
about the scan itself NSR or NBE formats do not include in the report.
.P
Basically, XML is a merge between the .nbe reports and the .nessusrc
configuration file. You won't get extra verbosity or diagnosis info in
the XML report, but you'll know which plugins (and which version of
these plugins) have been enabled during the scan.
.P
For more information on the report formats please read the files
.B nsr_file_format.txt
and
.B nbe_file_format.txt
provided along with the documentation.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP 
.B HOME
The path to the user's home directory which will hold the client
configuration cache
.IR .nessusrc .
The path is refered to as
.IR ~/ ,
below.

.TP
.B NESSUSHOME
If this environment variable is set, this path is used instead of the
path defined by the 
.B HOME
variable.  This path is referred to as
.IR ~/ ,
below.

% More examples should be included here (jfs)
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
To run a batch scan from a cron job and publish it in a given
web space (
.B /var/www/html/nessus/
) try the following:
.P
.B nessus -c /root/nessus/nessus.rc -T html -qx localhost 1241 batch batch1
.B /root/nessus/target /var/www/html/nessus/results.html
.P
Make sure that paranoia level is
.B not
set in your
.B nessus.rc
configuration file, otherwise the scan will not work

.SH FILES
.TP 
.I ~/.nessusrc
is the client configuration file, which contains the options about which 
.B nessusd
server to connect to, which plugins to activate, and so on.  The file is 
created automatically if it does not exist.
