DESCRIPTION OF THE NBE FILE FORMAT

The .nbe file format was designed to facilitate the export of Nessusd reports
to other tools.

The format is the following for each line :

<category>|<subnet>|<host>|[Info]

Where :

<category> is either "timestamps" or "results".

If <category> is timestamps, then the format of [info] is :

<action>|<time>|

with

    <action> = scan_start, scan_end, host_start or host_end
    if action is scan_{start,end} then the fields subnet and host are empty.

    If <category> is "results", then [info] is plain old .nsr, that is :
    <port>|<plugin_id>|<category>|<report>
    (described in the file nsr_file_format.txt)

    With <port> being the port in plain text (ie: "tcpmux (1/tcp)"),
    <plugin_id> is the ID of the plugin which generated an alert, <category>
    is one of {Security Hole, Security Warning, Security Note} and <report>
    is the report, with return carriages and newlines escaped as '\r' and '\n'
