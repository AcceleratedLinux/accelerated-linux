This folder is about the Nessus Transfer Protocol (NTP -- bad acronym,
I know).

It may be of some interest to anyone who is willing to write a new
front end to the Nessus server, but not to anyone else...



Note that NTP was not well designed, and suffers from several flaws. 
The developement of the Nessus 1.1.x series will start with a new,
nice and clean communication protocol
