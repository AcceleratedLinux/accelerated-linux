Before you install libnasl, the package 'nessus-libraries' should
be installed on your system. Make sure that the program 'nessus-config'
is in your path, or else you won't be able to compile libnasl. 'nessus-config'
is installed in /usr/local/bin.

The compilation of libnasl is straightforward :

	./configure
	make

and then as root :

	make install
