/* g_disk_bitmap initially contains copy of disk bitmaps
   (cautious version of it);

   g_new_bitmap initially has marked only super block, bitmap blocks
   and bits after the end of bitmap

   in pass 1 we go through g_disk_bitmap. 

   If block does not look like formatted node, we skip it.

   If block contains internal node, put 0 in g_disk_bitmap if block is
   not used in new tree yet.

   If block contains leaf and is used already (by an indirect item
   handled already to this time) save all items. They will be inserted
   into tree after pass 1.

   If block looking like leaf is not used in the new tree, try to
   insert in into tree. If it is not possible, mark block in
   g_uninsertable_leaf_bitmap. Blocks marked in this bitmap will be inserted into tree in pass 2. They can not be

  This means, that in pass 1 when we have
   found block containing the internal nodes we mark it in
   g_disk_bitmap as free (reiserfs_free_internal_block). When block
   gets into new tree it is marked in g_new_bitmap (mark_block_used)
   When collecting resources for do_balance, we mark new blocks with
   mark_block_used. After do_balance we unmark unused new blocks in
   g_new_bitmap (bitmap.c:/reiserfs_free_block)

   Allocating of new blocks: look for 0 bit in g_disk_bitmap
   (find_zero_bit_in_bitmap), make sure, that g_new_bitmap contains 0
   at the corresponding bit (is_block_used).
