.SH NAME
Tcl_CreateInterp, Tcl_DeleteInterp \- create and delete Tcl command interpreters
.SH SYNOPSIS

Token for interpreter to be destroyed.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateInterp\fR creates a new interpreter structure and returns
a token for it.  The token is required in calls to most other Tcl
procedures, such as \fBTcl_CreateCommand\fR, \fBTcl_Eval\fR, and
\fBTcl_DeleteInterp\fR.
Clients are only allowed to access a few of the fields of
Tcl_Interp structures;  see the Tcl_Interp
and \fBTcl_CreateCommand\fR man pages for details.
The new interpreter is initialized with no defined variables and only
the built-in Tcl commands.  To bind in additional commands, call
\fBTcl_CreateCommand\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteInterp\fR destroys a command interpreter and releases all of
the resources associated with it, including variables, procedures,
and application-specific command bindings.  After \fBTcl_DeleteInterp\fR
returns the caller should never again use the \fIinterp\fR token.
