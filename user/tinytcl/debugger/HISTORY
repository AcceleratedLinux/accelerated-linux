This is the HISTORY file for the Tcl debugger.

Date	Version	Description
-------	-------	------------------------------------------------------
7/3/95	1.4.4	Fine-tuned aclocal so that it would prefer later versions
		for Tcl 7.4 support.

5/18/95 1.4.3	Picked up Cygnus' new configure, aclocal, and autoconf-2.3.

		Made with_tclinclude take priority over possibilities.

		Kannan Varadhan <kannan@isi.edu> noted incorrect diag reporting
		TCLHDIR in configure.

2/24/95	1.4.2	Larry Virden noted configure was not correctly rewriting from
		--(exec-)prefix.  Due to new autoconf.  Also noted glob was
		finding tclX directory.

2/22/95	1.4.1	Moved to autoconf-2.1 and m4-1.4.  

		Edward Murphy <emurphy@cs.uno.edu> noted that alpha-dec-osf2.0
		with gcc reported conflicting types for strchr.  I deleted it
		since tclInt.h includes its own already.  Also swapped
		backwards #define.

1/21/95 1.4.0	Larry Virden noted that tclIndex was incorrect.

		Hugo van der Sanden <hv@cix.compulink.co.uk> noted that with
		7.4, all commands are evaluated at global level.  Modified
		interpreter to account for the change in Tcl_RecordAndEval to
		call Tcl_GlobalEval instead of Tcl_Eval.

12/29/31 1.3.1	Karl Vogel noted Pyramid has index instead of strchr.

		Joe Fasano noted Dbg_cf.h ended with open comment on # line.

11/4/94 1.3.0	Breakpoints interrupted interactive commands.  Gee, how could
		I have missed this before?

		Bert Robben <Bert.Robben@CS.kuleuven.ac.be> noted that the
		debugger needs to know about the presence of stdlib.h.  I was
		hoping to avoid this because it's a pain getting configure to
		call another configure.  Added Dbg_cf.h.in file.

		Larry Virden (lwv26@cas.org) noted INSTALL misidentified the .a
		file.

8/30/93 1.2.0	Tom Tromey noted boolean vals of bp exprs were not checked.

8/14/94	1.1.2	Owen Rees <rtor@ansa.co.uk> noted mismatches in Makefile.

		Tom Tromey added support for ClientData in Interactor and
		Output funcs.

7/18/94	1.1.1	Tom Tromey <tromey@busco.lanl.gov> noted a loose putchar.

		Rick Lyons <pclink@qus102.qld.tne.oz.au> noted that Pyramid
		doesn't have stdlib.h.  See note at beginning of Dbg.c.

		Breakpoint actions mishandled r and some other dbg commands.

		Added script library for p command.

3/21/94 1.1.0	Changed remaining free to ckfree.

		Dbg_ArgcArgv failed to save argc, so no args were showing in
		first line of w, only program name.

		Made empty commands default to last previous action command.

1/14/93	1.0.10	Forgot to include Dbg_cmd.c in distribution!

1/12/93	1.0.9	Added Dbg_Init to simplify use even further.  See INSTALL.

		Cleaned up configure and INSTALL quite a bit.

11/14/93 1.0.8	Rick <pclink@qus102.qld.npb.telecom.com.au> says Pyramid chokes
		when varargs is included twice (2nd time from tclInt.h).

11/1/93 1.0.7	Lou-Salkind@deshaw.com found interpreter() could stomp past end
		of input array.

		Joe Fasano <joe@veritas.com> requested an output routine so
		that non-interactor output could be redirected.  I added
		Dbg_Output.

		Karl Vogel <vogelke@c-17igp.wpafb.af.mil> noted Pyramid didn't
		like calling thru fn ptrs w/o using *, and a real bug, casting
		the debugger cmd enums from void.

9/11/93	1.0.6	Dbg_On(,1) only permitted a single command, so things like w
		couldn't possibly work.  Fixed.  But Dbg_On(,1) cannot possibly
		intuit the current command.  Also, if Dbg_On(,1) invoked as a
		Tcl async (i.e., from interrupt), we can't interrupt again
		until first interrupt completes.  This shouldn't be a problem
		for anyone but it should be documented.

9/9/93	1.0.5	Przemek Klosowski <przemek@rrdbartok.nist.gov> noted that some
		Tcl 6 incompats had crept in.

9/9/93	1.0.4	John Robert LoVerso <loverso@osf.org> noted HP compiler
		complained about assigning int to enum.

9/1/93	1.0.3	Jiunn-Chen Lin <faust@x1sund.ccl.itri.org.tw> noted wish dies
		on "update" and fixes for Tcl 7.03b.  No longer compat with
		earlier Tcl 7, but still compat with Tcl 6.

		Added a patch to fix tkMain.c for the update problem.  Added
		instructions to INSTALL describing how to get going quickly.

8/22/93	1.0.2	Made compatible with Tcl 7.0b2.  Still compatible with Tcl 6.

		Fixed misbehavior of "n" if procedure was inside Tcl_Eval
		which was not in a procedure (i.e., source).  Currently, Tcl
		does have enough power to have "n" stop after commands (i.e.,
		source).  Provide "N" as a temporary alternative.

		Tightened symbol names a bit.

		Chip Rosenthal <chip@chinacat.unicom.com> noted type decl err.

6/12/93	1.0.1	configure was not executable; accidentally depended on dummy.h

		fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com noted minor type decl error.

6/8/93	1.0.0	Released
