This file describes things in the current release that are not in the
paper presented at the Tcl/Tk Conference (see README).

User Interface Changes ---------------------------------------------------

-- Added p command which prints either scalar or array.  Note that this
is a user-level procedure so it requires the default handling of unknown.

-- The N command is useful for stepping over Tcl_Eval calls that are not
inside a procedure or command.  For instance, if you are about to
executed a "source" command, n will stop at the first command inside
the sourced file while N will stop after the source is complete.

-- Pressing return without entering an explicit command will cause the
last previous action command to be executed.  For example, if you have
just executed a step command, pressing return will execute another
step command.  Actions commands are s, n, N, r, and c.  If you have
not entered an action command, it defaults to n.

Tcl-Application Interface Changes ----------------------------------------

-- The function Dbg_Init makes the debugger trivial to drop into
applications.  It works like other App_Init functions, taking an
interp argument and returning TCL_OK.  Dbg_Init creates a command
called "debug" in the current interpreter.

This will add a "debug" command to your interpreter.  (Inside your
application, "debug 1" will start the interpreter.  "debug 0" will
stop it.

You can also use give the command a different name (see the INSTALL
file for more info).

-- The function Dbg_Interactor was modified to take an extra argument
of ClientData.  This argument is passed back to the interactor when it
is called.  The return value of Dbg_Interactor is a structure
containing the original arguments.

-- The function Dbg_Output was created to send all debugger output
somewhere other than the standard output.  For example, if you want to
run it inside of Tk and send it to a window, you can do this.
Dbg_Output takes an interp, a Dbg_OutputProc, and a ClientData as
arguments.  Dbg_OutputProc takes an interp, the string to be output as
arguments, and ClientData.  The return value of Dbg_Output is a
structure containing the original arguments.
