I was highly surprised that TclX package, which provides a lot of
Unix-specific functionality for Tcl doesn't provide interface to syslog. 

So, I've designed my own package.

It is not fully TEA-compliant extension yet, becouse I haven't just
got time for writing proper autoconf configuration, but should be fairly
easy to configure and build by anybody who knows what syslog is and why
to use it.

This version is designed for Tcl 8.0 or below. It uses old string-based
API and should be compatible with any Tcl version down to 7.4

If you use tcl 8.1 or above go and get tclsyslog-2.0 

Home site of this package is at

http://www.ice.ru/~vitus/works/tcl.html#syslog

Installation

1. Edit variables on the top of Makefile
2. Do make all
3. Test extension by loading it into tclsh via load ./libsyslog.so.1.1 
   and sending couple of messages from command line
4. Verify that PREFIX variable set so that ${PREFIX}/lib is included in
   your tcl_pkgPath (or set LIBDIR to directory in tcl_pkgPath)
   and do make install
   Note that GNU install is assumed. Use install-sh provided in tcl
   distribution if your install is not GNU install
