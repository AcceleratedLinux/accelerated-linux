.SH NAME
pam_krb5 \- Kerberos 5 authentication

.SH DESCRIPTION
pam_krb5.so reads its configuration information from the \fBappdefaults\fR
section of \fBkrb5.conf\fR(5).  You should read the \fBkrb5.conf\fR(5) man page
before continuing here.  The module expects its configuration information to be
in the \fBpam\fR subsection of the \fBappdefaults\fR section.

.SH DIRECTIVES
Directives which take a \fItrue\fR, \fIfalse\fR, or a PAM service name can also
be selectively disabled for specific PAM services using the related "no_"
option (exceptions to "debug = true" can be made using "no_debug", for example).

.IP "debug = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
turns on debugging via \fBsyslog\fR(3).  Debug messages are logged with
priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fR.

.IP "debug_sensitive = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
turns on debugging of sensitive information via \fBsyslog\fR(3).  Debug
messages are logged with priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fR.

.IP "addressless = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
if set, requests a TGT with no address information.  This can be necessary
if you are using Kerberos through a NAT, or on systems whose IP addresses change
regularly.  This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fR
\fBnoaddresses\fR directive.

.IP "afs_cells = \fIcell.example.com [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain tokens for the listed cells,
in addition to the local cell and the cell which
contains the user's home directory, for the user.
The module will guess the principal name of the AFS
service for the listed cells, or it can be specified by listing cells
in the form \fIcellname\fB=principalname\fR.

.IP "banner = \fIKerberos 5\fR"
specifies what sort of password the module claims to be changing whenever it is
called upon to change passwords.  The default is \fBKerberos 5\fR.

.IP "ccache_dir = \fI/var/tmp\fR"
specifies the directory in which to place credential cache files.  The default
is \fI/tmp\fR.

.IP "ccname_template = \fIKEYRING:krb5cc_%U_%P\fR"
.IP "ccname_template = \fIFILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX\fR"
specifies the location in which to place the user's session-specific
credential cache.  This value is treated as a template, and these sequences
are substituted:
  %u	login name
  %U	login UID
  %p	principal name
  %r	realm name
  %h	home directory
  %d	the default ccache directory (as set with \fIccache_dir\fR)
  %P	the current process ID
  %%	literal '%'

The default is \fIFILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX\fR".

.IP "existing_ticket = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to accept the presence of pre-existing Kerberos credentials
provided by the calling application in the default credential cache as
sufficient to authenticate the user, and to skip any account management checks.
The default is \fBfalse\fR.
.IP
DANGER!  Unless validation is also in use, it is relatively easy to produce a
credential cache which looks "good enough" to fool pam_krb5.so.

.IP "external = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIsshd ftp [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to use Kerberos credentials provided by the calling
application during session setup.
.\" This is most often useful for obtaining
.\" AFS tokens or a
.\" krb4 ticket.
This is most often useful for obtaining AFS tokens.
The default is "\fIsshd\fR".

.IP "forwardable = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
controls whether or not credentials are forwardable.  
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fR
\fBforwardable\fR directive.

.IP "hosts = \fIhostname [...]\fR"
specifies which other hosts credentials obtained by pam_krb5 will be good on.
If your host is behind a firewall, you should add the IP address or name that
the \fIKDC\fR sees it as to this list.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fR
\fBextra_addresses\fR directive.

.IP "ignore_afs=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to completely ignore the presence of AFS, preventing
any attempts to obtain new tokens on behalf of the calling application.

.IP "ignore_unknown_principals=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
.IP "ignore_unknown_spn=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
.IP "ignore_unknown_upn=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
specifies which other not pam_krb5 should return a PAM_IGNORE code to libpam
instead of PAM_USER_UNKNOWN for users for whom the determined principal name
is expired or does not exist.

.IP "initial_prompt=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so whether or not to ask for a password before attempting
authentication.  If one is needed and pam_krb5.so has not prompted for it, the
Kerberos library should trigger a request for a password.

.IP "keytab = \fIFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab\fR
.IP "keytab = \fIFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab imap=FILE:/etc/imap.keytab\fR"
specifies the name of a keytab file to search for a service key for use
in validating TGTs.  The location can be specified on a per-service basis
by specifying a list of locations in the form \fIpam_service\fR=\fIlocation\fR.
The default is \fIFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab\fR.

.\" .IP "krb4_convert = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
.\" controls whether or not pam_krb5 tries to get Kerberos IV credentials
.\" from the KDC (or using the \fBkrb524d\fR service on the KDC) and
.\" create ticket files with them.  Unless you've converted
.\" \fIeverything\fR on your network over to use Kerberos 5, you'll want
.\" to leave this set to \fBtrue\fR.  Note that this may require valid
.\" Kerberos IV configuration data to be present in \fB/etc/krb.conf\fR
.\" and \fB/etc/krb.realms\fR.  This option is poorly named.
.\" This option defaults to \fItrue\fR if AFS is detected.
.\" 
.\" .IP "krb4_convert_524 = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
.\" controls whether or not pam_krb5 tries to get Kerberos IV credentials
.\" using the \fBkrb524d\fR service.  This option modifies the
.\" \fBkrb4_convert\fP option.  If disabled, pam_krb5 will only attempt
.\" to obtain Kerberos IV credentials using the KDC
.\" (unless the \fBkrb4_use_as_req\fR option is also disabled).
.\" 
.\" .IP "krb4_use_as_req = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
.\" controls whether or not pam_krb5 tries to get Kerberos IV credentials
.\" using the KDC.  This option modifies the
.\" \fBkrb4_convert\fP option.  If disabled, pam_krb5 will only attempt
.\" to obtain Kerberos IV credentials using the \fBkrb524d\fR service
.\" (unless the \fBkrb4_convert_524\fR option is also disabled).
.\" 
.IP "mappings = \fIregex1 regex2 [...]\fR"
specifies that pam_krb5 should derive the user's principal name from the Unix
user name by first checking if the user name matches \fBregex1\fR, and
formulating a principal name using \fBregex2\fR.  For example,
\fB"mappings = EXAMPLE\e(.*) $1@EXAMPLE.COM\fR"
would map any user with a name of the form "EXAMPLE\ewhatever" to a principal
name of "whatever@EXAMPLE.COM".  This is primarily targeted at allowing
pam_krb5 to be used to authenticate users whose user information is provided by
\fBwinbindd\fP(8).  This will frequently require the reverse to be configured by
setting up an auth_to_local rule elsewhere in \fBkrb5.conf\fP(5).

.IP "minimum_uid = \fI0\fR"
specifies the minimum UID of users being authenticated.  If a user with a UID
less than this value attempts authentication, the request will be ignored.

.\" .IP "pkinit_flags = \fI0\fR"
.\" controls the flags value which pam_krb5 passes to libkrb5
.\" when setting up PKINIT parameters.  This is useful mainly for
.\" debugging.
.\" 
.\" .IP "pkinit_identity = \fI\fR"
.\" controls where pam_krb5 instructs libkrb5 to search for the
.\" user's private key and certificate, so that the client can be
.\" authenticated using PKINIT, if the KDC supports it.  This value
.\" is treated as a template, and these sequences are substituted:
.\"   %u	login name
.\"   %U	login UID
.\"   %p	principal name
.\"   %r	realm name
.\"   %h	home directory
.\"   %d	the default ccache directory (as set with \fIccache_dir\fR)
.\"   %P	the current process ID
.\"   %%	literal '%'
.\" .br
.\" Other PKINIT-specific defaults, such as the locations of trust
.\" anchors, can be set in krb5.conf(5).
.\" 
.IP "preauth_options = \fI\fR"
controls the preauthentication options which pam_krb5 passes
to libkrb5, if the system-defaults need to be overridden.
The list is treated as a template, and these sequences are
substituted:
  %u	login name
  %U	login UID
  %p	principal name
  %r	realm name
  %h	home directory
  %d	the default ccache directory (as set with \fIccache_dir\fR)
  %P	the current process ID
  %%	literal '%'

.IP "proxiable = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
controls whether or not credentials are proxiable.  If not specified, they
are.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fR
\fBproxiable\fR directive.

.IP "null_afs=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so, when it attempts to set tokens, to try to get
credentials for services with names which resemble afs@\fIREALM\fR
before attempting to get credentials for services with names resembling
afs/\fIcell\fR@\fIREALM\fR.  The default is to assume that the cell's
name is the instance in the AFS service's Kerberos principal name.

.IP "pwhelp = \fIfilename\fR"
specifies the name of a text file whose contents will be displayed to
clients who attempt to change their passwords.  There is no default.

.IP "renew_lifetime = \fI36000\fR"
default renewable lifetime, in seconds.  This specifies how much time you have
after getting credentials to renew them.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fR
\fBrenew_lifetime\fR directive.

.IP "subsequent_prompt = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice\ [...]\fR"
controls whether or not pam_krb5.so will allow the Kerberos library to ask
the user for a password or other information, if the previously-entered
password is somehow insufficient for authenticating the user.  This is
commonly needed to allow a user to log in when that user's password has
expired.  The default is \fBtrue\fR.

If the calling application does not properly support PAM conversations
(possibly due to limitations of a network protocol which it is serving),
this may be need to be disabled for that application to prevent it
from supplying the user's current password in a password-changing
situations when a new password is called for.

.IP "ticket_lifetime = \fI36000\fR"
default credential lifetime, in seconds.

.IP "tokens = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice\ [...]\fR"
signals that pam_krb5.so should create an AFS PAG and obtain tokens
during authentication in addition to session setup.  This is primarily
useful in server applications which need to access a user's files but
which do not open PAM sessions before doing so.  For correctly-written
applications, this flag is not necessary.

.IP "token_strategy = \fIrxk5,2b[,...]\fR"
controls how, and using which format, pam_krb5.so should attept to
set AFS tokens for the user's session.
By default, the module is configured with
"token_strategy = \fIv4,524,2b,rxk5\fR".
Recognized strategy names include:
 \fIrxk5\fP  rxk5 (requires OpenAFS 1.6 or later)
 \fI2b\fP    rxkad "2b" (requires OpenAFS 1.2.8 or later)
.\"  \fI524\fP   Kerberos 524 service + traditional Kerberos IV
.\"  \fIv4\fP    traditional Kerberos IV

.IP "use_shmem = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice\ [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to pass credentials from the authentication service function
to the session management service function using shared memory for specific
services.  By default, the module is configured with
"use_shmem = \fIsshd\fR".

.IP "validate = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice\ [...]\fR"
specifies whether or not to attempt validation of the TGT.  The default is
\fBfalse\fR.
