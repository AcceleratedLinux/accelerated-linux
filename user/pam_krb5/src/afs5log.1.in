.SH NAME
afs5log \- AFS token initializer

.SH SYNOPSIS
afs5log [ [-v] [-5] [-k] [-p \fIpath\fP] [cell[=principal] ] ] [...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIafs5log\fP command uses Kerberos to obtain AFS tokens for the named
cells.  If no cell is named, tokens are obtained for the local cell.  If the
principal name of the \fIafs\fP service for the cell is known, the cell
name may also be given in the form \fIcell\fP=\fIprincipal_name\fP.
Attempts are made to obtain Kerberos IV credentials first, and if that fails,
\fIafs5log\fP will create Kerberos 5 (\fI2b-style\fP) tokens.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
-v
Turns on verbose mode.  \fIafs5log\fP will print debugging messages while it
does its work.  Use more than once to get more detail.
.TP
-p \fIpath\fP
Determine which cell the specified \fIpath\fP resides in, and obtain tokens for
that cell.
.TP
-s \fIstrategy\fP
Overrides the default token-setting strategy
("\fI@DEFAULT_TOKEN_STRATEGY@\fP") with
the named strategy.  Recognized strategy names include:
 \fIrxk5\fP  rxk5 (requires OpenAFS 1.6 or later)
 \fI2b\fP    rxkad "2b" (requires OpenAFS 1.2.8 or later)
@MAN_KRB4@ \fI524\fP   Kerberos 524 service + traditional Kerberos IV
@MAN_KRB4@ \fIv4\fP    traditional Kerberos IV
.TP
-5
Skip attempts to use Kerberos IV and just use \fI2b\fP-style tokens, which are
only supported by OpenAFS 1.2.8 and later.
.TP
-k
Skip attempts to use Kerberos IV and use \fIrxk5\fP-style tokens, which are
only supported by OpenAFS 1.6 and later.
.TP
-n
Assume that, if a cell name and a realm name differ only by case, that the
name of the AFS service's principal name doesn't include an instance.

Probably, but let's hope not.  If you find any, please file them in the
