OID version 0.01
================

The NetSNMP::OID class is a simple wrapper around a C-based net-snmp
oid.  The OID is internally stored as a C array of integers for speed
purposes when doing comparisons, etc.  The standard logical expression
operators (<, >, ==, ...) are overloaded such that lexographical
comparisons may be done with them.
