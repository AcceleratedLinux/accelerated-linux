.SH NAME
snmpbulkget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GETBULK requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpbulkget
[APPLICATION OPTIONS] [COMMON OPTIONS] OID [OID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpbulkget
is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GETBULK request to query a
network entity efficiently for information.  One or more object
identifiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables(5) .
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
pinpoint why the request was malformed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI -Cn <NUM>
Set the
.I non-repeaters
field in the GETBULK PDU.  This specifies the number of supplied
variables that should not be iterated over.  The default is 0.
.TP
.BI -Cr <NUM>
Set the
.I max-repetitions
field in the GETBULK PDU.  This specifies the maximum number of
iterations over the repeating variables.  The default is 10.
.PP
In addition to these options,
.B snmpbulkget
takes the common options described in the 
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
.SH EXAMPLE
The command:
.PP
snmpbulkget -v2c -Cn1 -Cr5 -Os -c public zeus system ifTable
.PP
will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 (which is the
lexicographically next object to system) and the first 5 objects in
the ifTable:
.PP
sysDescr.0 = STRING: "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.br
ifIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1
.br
ifIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2
.br
ifDescr.1 = STRING: "lo0"
.br
et cetera.
.SH NOTE
As the name implies,
.B snmpbulkget
utilizes the SNMP GETBULK message, which is not available in SNMPv1.
