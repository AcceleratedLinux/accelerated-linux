.UC 4
.SH NAME
snmpgetnext - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GETNEXT requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpgetnext
[COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] OID [OID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpget
is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GETNEXT request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers
(OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each variable
name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables(5) .
For each one, the variable that is lexicographically "next" in the
remote entity's MIB will be returned.
.PP
For example:
.PP
snmpgetnext -c public zeus interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1
.PP
will retrieve the variable interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2:
.PP
interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2 = softwareLoopback(24)
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
error message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the
request was malformed.
.SH OPTIONS
.B snmpgetnext
takes the common options described in the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page and also the
.B -Cf
option described in the
.I snmpget(1)
manual page.
