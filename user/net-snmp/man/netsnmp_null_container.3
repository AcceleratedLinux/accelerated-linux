.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Helps you implement specialized containers. 

This is a simple container that doesn't actually contain anything. All the methods simply log a debug message and return.
.PP
The original intent for this container is as a wrapper for a specialized container. Implement the functions you need, create a null_container, and override the default functions with your specialized versions.
.PP
You can use the 'container:null' debug token to see what functions are being called, to help determine if you need to implement them.
