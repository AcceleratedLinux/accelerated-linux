The "buildpackage-solaris" script does a "one-shot" build 
and packaging of an untarred net-snmp distribution 
on Solaris without requiring root access. 
 
The resulting native Solaris package can then be 
(automatically) installed/removed using the Solaris 
pkgadd(1)/pkgrm(1) commands. 
 
The script requires customization of your 
development environment - see attached file 
DEVENV - before it can be used. 
 
 Basic usage: ./buildpackage-solaris distclean 
 
The script "elfdepend.sh" is required to 
determine the dependencies of all built ELF binaries 
and libraries to create a "package dependency file" - 
see depend(4).
