.TH CARDCTL 8 "2000/12/13 16:50:26" "pcmcia-cs"
.SH NAME
cardctl \- PCMCIA card control utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcardctl\fR [\fB-V\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIsocket\fR]
.br
\fBcardctl\fR
[\fB\-c \fIconfig\fR] [\fB\-f \fIscheme\fR] [\fB\-s \fIstab\fR]
\fBscheme\fR [\fIname\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCardctl\fR is used to monitor and control the state of PCMCIA
sockets.  If a socket number is specified, the command will be applied
to just one socket; otherwise, all sockets will be affected.
.PP
\fBCardctl\fR is also used to select between multiple PCMCIA
configuration schemes.  The current scheme name is passed to the
device option scripts as part of the ``device address'', so the
scripts can use it to choose between different setups.
.PP
If \fBcardctl\fR is executed by root, all commands are available.  If
it is executed by an unpriviledged user, only the informational
commands are accessible.
.PP
Some commands may not work or give misleading results if \fBcardmgr\fR
is not running.
