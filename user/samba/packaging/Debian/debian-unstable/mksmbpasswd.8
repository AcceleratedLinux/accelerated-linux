.SH NAME
mksmbpasswd \- formats a /etc/passwd entry for a smbpasswd file
.SH SYNOPSIS
mksmbpasswd cat /etc/passwd | /usr/sbin/mksmbpasswd > /etc/samba/smbpasswd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mksmbpasswd
should be used only once, the first time Samba is installed. The idea
is to ease accounts creation by transferring all user accounts from 
/etc/passwd to /etc/samba/smbpasswd.
.PP
Please note that passwords are not transferred automatically from
/etc/passwd to the new /etc/samba/smbpasswd file. After running
.B mksmbpasswd
all accounts are disabled so the system administrator must run
smbpasswd for each account that needs to be enable.
.SH FILES
.TP
/etc/passwd
System wide accounts file

/etc/samba/smbpasswd
Encrypted passwords file for the Samba daemons
