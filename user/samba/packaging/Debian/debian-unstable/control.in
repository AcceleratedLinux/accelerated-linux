Description: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the components necessary to turn your
 Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server.
 .
 Currently, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:
 .
  samba - LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.
  samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
  smbclient - LanManager-like simple client for Unix.
  swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
  samba-doc - Samba documentation.
  smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.2.x and above).
  libpam-smbpass - pluggable authentication module for SMB password database
  libsmbclient - Shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB servers
  libsmbclient-dev - libsmbclient shared libraries
  winbind: Service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers
  python2.3-samba: Python bindings that allow access to various aspects of Samba
 .
 It is possible to install a subset of these packages depending on
 your particular needs. For example, to access other SMB servers you
 should only need the smbclient and samba-common packages.

Package: samba-common
Architecture: any
Depends: libpam-modules, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Replaces: samba (<< 3.0.20b-1)
Description: Samba common files used by both the server and the client
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains the common files that are used by both the server
 (provided in the samba package) and the client (provided in the smbclient
 package).

Package: smbclient

Description: a LanManager-like simple client for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains some client components of the Samba suite. In
 particular it includes the command line utilities smbclient, smbtar,
 and smbspool. If you want to mount shares exported from Microsoft
 Windows machines or a Samba server you must install the smbfs package.

Package: swat
Architecture: any
Depends: samba (= ${Source-Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: samba-doc
Description: Samba Web Administration Tool
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains the components of the Samba suite that are needed
 for Web administration of the Samba server.
 .
 Note: if you want to use the on-line documentation that is accesible
 through the Swat front-end you must install the samba-doc package.

Package: samba-doc
Section: doc
Architecture: all
Description: Samba documentation
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the documentation that comes in the original
 tarball.

Package: smbfs
Section: otherosfs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: netbase (>= 2.02), samba-common (= ${Source-Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: smbclient
Replaces: smbfsx
Conflicts: smbfsx, suidmanager (<< 0.50)
Description: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.2.x)
 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 LAN Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 If you want to use command-line utilities like smbclient, smbtar
 and/or smbspool you just need to install the smbclient package.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.2.0-1, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x have been removed. There are no wrapper scripts
 that call a specific smbmount/smbumount depending on the kernel
 version.  If you are using a 2.0.x kernel please upgrade or use the
 latest Samba 2.0.7 Debian package.

Package: libpam-smbpass
Section: admin
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: samba
Description: pluggable authentication module for SMB password database
 This is a stackable PAM module that allows a system administrator to easily
 migrate to using encrypted passwords for Samba and to keep smb passwords in
 sync with unix passwords.  Unlike other solutions, it does this without
 requiring users to change their existing passwords or login to Samba using
 cleartext passwords.

Package: libsmbclient
Section: libs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB servers
 libsmbclient allows to write applications that use the SMB protocol.
 This gives applications the ability to talk to Microsoft Windows servers
 and Unix servers running Samba.
 .
 This package contains the libsmbclient shared library.

Package: libsmbclient-dev
Section: libdevel
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: libsmbclient (= ${Source-Version})
Description: libsmbclient static libraries and headers
 libsmbclient allows to write applications that use the SMB protocol.
 This gives applications the ability to talk to Microsoft Windows servers
 and Unix servers running Samba.
 .
 This package contains the libsmbclient static libraries and headers
 needed to build applications that use SMB services.

Package: winbind
Section: net
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

Description: service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers
 This package provides the winbindd daemon, which provides a
 service for the Name Service Switch capability that is present
 in most modern C libraries (like the GNU C Library - glibc.)
 .
 The service provided by winbindd is called `winbind' and
 can be used to resolve user and group information from a
 Windows NT server. The service can also provide authentication
 services via an associated PAM module.

Package: python2.3-samba
Section: python
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, python2.3
Description: Python bindings that allow access to various aspects of Samba
 The Samba Python bindings allow you to access various aspects of Samba.
 At the moment their status is "experimental" but they have been reported
 to work well.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/python2.3-samba/examples for a couple of examples.

Package: samba-dbg
Section: devel
Architecture: any
Depends: samba (= ${Source-Version})
Description: Samba debugging symbols

 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the programs included in
 the samba and smbclient packages.
