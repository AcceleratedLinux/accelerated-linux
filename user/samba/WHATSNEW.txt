                   ===============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.25a
                             May 25, 2007
                   ===============================

This is the second production release of the Samba 3.0.25 code 
base and is the version that servers should be run for for all 
current bug fixes.  

Major bug fixes included in Samba 3.0.25a are:

  o Missing supplementary Unix group membership when using "force 
    group".
  o Premature expiration of domain user passwords when using a 
    Samba domain controller.
  o Failure to open the Windows object picker against a server
    configured to use "security = domain".
  * Authentication failures when using security = server.


Changes to MS-DFS Root Share Behavior
=====================================

Please be aware that the initial value for the "msdfs root" share 
parameter was changed in the 3.0.25 release series and that this 
option is now disabled by default.  Windows clients frequently require 
a reboot in order to clear any cached information about MS-DFS
root shares on a server and you may experience failures accessing
file services on Samba 3.0.25 servers until the client reboot 
is performed.  Alternately, you may explicitly re-enable the 
parameter in smb.conf.   Please refer to the smb.conf(5) man page
for more details.

                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.25
                            May 14, 2007
                   ==============================

The 3.0.25 release is an upgrade release over the 3.0.23/3.0.24 
series which means that a substantial amount of development has 
occurred and many new features have been added since the last
Samba production release.  We would like to thank everyone in 
the Samba community that help to test the preview snapshots and 
release candidates.  We believe that the this production release 
is in much better shape due to your help.  

Major features included in the 3.0.25 code base include:

  o Significant improvements in the winbind off-line logon support.
  o Support for secure DDNS updates as part of the 'net ads join' 
    process.
  o Rewritten IdMap interface which allows for TTL based caching and 
    per domain backends.
  o New plug-in interface for the "winbind nss info" parameter.
  o New file change notify subsystem which is able to make use of 
    inotify on Linux.
  o Support for passing Windows security descriptors to a VFS 
    plug-in allowing for multiple Unix ACL implements to running side 
    by side on the Same server.
  o Improved compatibility with Windows Vista clients including 
    improved read performance with Linux servers.
  o Man pages for IdMap and VFS plug-ins.

Security Fixes included in the Samba 3.0.25 release are:

  o CVE-2007-2444
	Versions: Samba 3.0.23d - 3.0.25pre2
	Local SID/Name translation bug can result in
	user privilege elevation

  o CVE-2007-2446
	Versions: Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.24
	Multiple heap overflows allow remote code execution

  o CVE-2007-2447
	Versions: Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.24
	Unescaped user input parameters are passed as
	arguments to /bin/sh allowing for remote command
	execution


Off-line Logons and AD Site Support
===================================

Winbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly
improved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating 
domain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site
information.


New IdMap Interface for Winbindd
================================

The 3.0.25 release of Samba includes a rewritten IdMap interface
for winbindd which replaces the "idmap backend" parameter.  Please 
refer to the "idmap domains" description in the smb.conf(5) man 
page for more details.


Dynamic DNS Updates
===================

The "net ads join" command is now able to register the host's DNS A
records with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This 
feature must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate 
when running the ./configure script.  There is also a related "net ads 
dns" command for refreshing a host's records which could be launched
from a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.


Support for Additional ACL Modules
==================================

Samba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer 
which means it is now possible to support multiple ACL implementations
on the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.


VFS ReadAhead Plugin
====================

Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved 
performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers
for caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between 
Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
module by adding the following lines to the share definition
in smb.conf:

[file_share]
	vfs objects = readahead

Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.


Windows Vista, Office 2007, and Offline Files
=============================================

Research surrounding offline files, Windows Vista, and Microsoft 
Office 2007 has revealed a incompatibility between these 
applications and the "map acl inherit = no" setting in smb.conf.  
Users requiring support client side caching (csc) and offline 
files are encouraged to enable the "map acl inherit" for any 
affected share definitions in the server's configuration.
Future versions of Samba will enable this setting by default.

Please refer to the smb.conf(5) man page for more details on 
"map acl inherit".

                   ===============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.23c
                             Aug 30, 2006
                   ===============================

We would like to thank the developers of the Saturn code analysis 
tool from Stanford University (http://glide.stanford.edu/saturn).
This release includes several code fixes based on its reports.

Common bugs fixed in 3.0.23c include:

  o Authentication failures in pam_winbind when the AD domain
    policy is set to not expire passwords.
  o Authorization failures when using smb.conf options such
    as "valid users" with the smbpasswd passdb backend.


RID Algorithms & Passdb
=======================

Starting with the 3.0.23c release, the officially supported passdb 
backends (smbpasswd, tdbsam, and ldapsam) now operate identically
with regards to the historical RID algorithm for unmapped users 
and groups (i.e. accounts not in the passdb or group mapping table).
The resulting behavior is that all unmapped users are resolved 
to a SID in the S-1-22-1 domain and all unmapped groups resolve
to a SID in the S-1-22-2 domain.  Previously, when using the 
smbpasswd passdb, such users and groups would resolve to an 
algorithmic SID in the machine's own domain (S-1-5-XX-XX-XX).
However, the smbpasswd backend still utilizes the RID algorithm
when creating new user accounts or allocating a RID for a new 
group mapping entry.

With the changes in the 3.0.23c release, it is now possible to 
resolve a uid/gid, name, or SID in any direction and always obtain
a symmetric mapping.  This is important so that values for smb.conf 
parameters such as "valid users" resolve to the same SIDs as those 
included  in the local user's initial token.

Most installations will notice no change.  However, because
an unmapped account's SID will now change even when using 
smbpasswd it is possible that any security descriptors on files
previously copied from a Samba host to a Windows NTFS partition
may now fail to give access. The workaround is to either manually
map all affect groups (or add impacted users to the server's 
passdb) or to manually reset the file's ACL.

                   ===============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.23b
                             Aug 7, 2006
                   ===============================

Common bugs fixed in 3.0.23b include:

  o Ambiguity with unqualified names in smb.conf parameters
    such as "force user" and "valid users".
  o Errors in 'net ads join' caused by bad IP address in the list
    of domain controllers.
  o SMB signing errors in the client and server code.
  o Domain join failures when using smbpasswd on a Samba PDC.


Member servers, domain accounts, and smb.conf
=============================================

Since Samba 3.0.8, it has been recommended that all domain accounts 
listed in smb.conf on a member server be fully qualified with the 
domain name.  This is now a requirement.  All unqualified names are 
assumed to be local to the Unix host, either as part of the server's 
local passdb or in the local system list of accounts (e.g. /etc/passwd 
or /etc/group).

The reason for this change is that smbd has transitioned from
access checks based on string comparisons to token based
authorization.  All names are resolved to a SID and then verified
against the logged on user's NT user token.  Local names will
resolve to a local SID, while qualified domain names will resolve
to the appropriate domain SID.  

If the member server is not running winbindd at all, domain 
accounts will be implicitly mapped to local accounts and their
tokens will be modified appropriately to reflect the local 
SID and group membership.

For example, the following share will restrict access to the
domain group "Linux Admins" and the local group srvadmin.

[restricted]
	path = /data
	valid users = +"DOMAIN\Linux Admins" +srvadmin

Note that to restrict the [homes] share on a member server to the 
owner of that directory, it is necessary to prefix the %S value 
to "valid users".

[global]
	security = {domain,ads}
	workgroup = DOM
	winbind separator = +
[homes]
	valid users = DOM+%S

                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.23
                            Jul 10, 2006
                   ==============================

There has been a substantial amount of cleanup work done during 
this development cycle.  We would like to thank both Coverity 
(http://www.coverity.com/) and Klocwork (http://www.klocwork.com/)
for analyzing the Samba source code. As a result, this release 
includes fixes for over 400 defects.  The coverage was approximately 
even with over 200 defects reported by each tool.

Thanks very much to those people who spent time testing the 
release candidates and reported their findings.  We would like to 
especially thank Thomas Bork <tombork@web.de> for his numerous 
reports.  We believe that the final release is in much better shape 
in large part due to his efforts.

New features in 3.0.23 include:

   o Improved 'make test'
   o New offline mode in winbindd.
   o New Kerberos support for pam_winbind.so.
   o New handling of unmapped users and groups. 
   o New non-root share management tools.
   o Improved support for local and BUILTIN groups.
   o Winbind IDMAP integration with RFC2307 schema objects supported 
     by Windows 2003 R2.
   o Rewritten 'net ads join' to mimic Windows XP without requiring 
     administrative rights to join a domain.


User and Group changes
======================

The user and group internal management routines have been 
rewritten to prevent overlaps of assigned Relative Identifiers 
(RIDs).  In the past the has been a potential problem when either 
manually mapping Unix groups with the 'net groupmap' command or 
when migrating a Windows domain to a Samba domain using 'net rpc 
vampire'.

Unmapped users are now assigned a SID in the S-1-22-1 domain and 
unmapped groups are assigned a SID in the S-1-22-2 domain. 
Previously they were assign a RID within the SAM on the Samba 
server.  For a DC this would have been under the authority of the 
domain SID where as on a member server or standalone host, this 
would have been under the authority of the local SAM (hint: net 
getlocalsid).

The result is that any unmapped users or groups on an upgraded 
Samba domain controller may be assigned a new SID.  Because the 
SID rather than a name is stored in Windows security descriptors, 
this can cause a user to no longer have access to a resource for 
example if a file was copied from a Samba file server to a local 
NTFS partition.  Any files stored on the Samba server itself will 
continue to be accessible because Unix stores the Unix gid and not 
the SID for authorization checks.

A further example will help illustrate the change.  Assume that a 
group named 'developers' exists with a Unix gid of 782 but this 
user does not exist in Samba's group mapping table. it would be 
perfectly normal for this group to be appear in an ACL editor.  
Prior to 3.0.23, the group SID might appear as 
S-1-5-21-647511796-4126122067-3123570092-2565. With 3.0.23, the 
group SID would be reported as S-1-22-2-782. Any security 
descriptors associated with files stored on an NTFS disk partition 
would not allow access based on the group permissions if the user 
was not a member of the 
S-1-5-21-647511796-4126122067-3123570092-2565 group. Because this 
group SID not reported in a user's token is S-1-22-2-782, Windows 
would fail the authorization check even though both SIDs in some 
respect referred to the same Unix group.

The current workaround is to create a manual domain group mapping 
entry for the group 'developers' to point at the 
S-1-5-21-647511796-4126122067-3123570092-2565 SID.


Passdb Changes
==============

The "passdb backend" parameter no long accepts multiple backends 
in a chaining configuration.  Also be aware that the SQL and XML 
based passdb modules have been removed in this release.  More 
information of external support for a SQL passdb module can be 
found at http://pdbsql.sourceforge.net/.


Group Mapping Changes
=====================

The default mapping entries for groups such as "Domain Admins" are 
no longer created when using an smbpasswd file or a tdbsam passdb 
backend.  This means that it is necessary to use 'net groupmap 
add' rather than 'net groupmap modify' to set these entries.  
This change has no effect on winbindd's IDmap functionality for 
domain groups.


LDAP Changes
============

There has also been a minor update the Samba LDAP schema file. A 
substring matching rule has been added to the sambaSID attribute 
definition.  For OpenLDAP servers, this will require the addition 
of 'index sambaSID sub' to the slapd.conf configuration file.  It 
will be necessary to run slapindex after making this change. There 
has been no change to actual data storage schema.

                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.22
                            Mar 30, 2006
                   ==============================

This is a security release of Samba. The Samba 3.0.21 release 
series (including the patch releases a through c) has been 
discovered to expose the clear text of the server's machine 
account credentials in the winbind log files when the log 
level is set to 5 or higher.  This defect has been assigned 
the CVE number CAN-2006-1059.

Summary
=======

The machine trust account password is the secret shared
between a domain controller and a specific member server.
Access to the member server machine credentials allows
an attacker to impersonate the server in the domain and 
gain access to additional information regarding domain 
users and groups.

The winbindd daemon included in Samba 3.0.21 and subsequent
patch releases (3.0.21a-c) writes the clear text of server's
machine credentials to its log file at level 5.  The winbindd
log files are world readable by default and often log files
are requested on open mailing lists as tools used to debug
server misconfigurations.

This affects servers configured to use domain or ads security
and possibly Samba domain controllers as well (if configured
to use winbindd).

from domain controllers.  In short, the RPC mechanisms used by 
"security = domain" to retrieve users and groups is not compatible 
with these changes.   The "security = ads" configuration is not 
affected by the Windows protocol changes.

Samba developers are actively working to correct this problem in 
the 3.0.21 release.  In the meantime, Administrators who are unable 
to migrate to "security = ads" and must continue using "security = 
domain", can define credentials to be used by winbindd for account
enumeration by executing the following command as root.

	wbinfo --set-auth-user='DOMAIN\username%password'

                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.20
                             Aug 19, 2005
                   ==============================

Additional features introduced in Samba 3.0.20 include:

  o Support for several new Win32 rpc pipes.
  o Improved support for OS/2 clients.
  o New 'net rpc service' tool for managing Win32 services.
  o Capability to set the owner on new files and directory
    based on the parent's ownership.
  o Experimental, asynchronous IO file serving support.
  o Completed Support for Microsoft Print Migrator.
  o New Winbind IDmap plugin (ad) for retrieving uid and gid
    from AD servers which maintain the SFU user and group 
    attributes.
  o Rewritten support for POSIX pathnames when utilizing 
    the Linux CIFS fs client.
  o New asynchronous winbindd.
  o Support for Microsoft Print Migrator.
  o New Windows NT registry file I/O library.
  o New user right (SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) added.
  o New "net share migrate" options.


What happened to 3.0.15 - 3.0.19?
==================================

After some discussion it was deemed that the amount of changes 
going into the next Samba 3.0 release needed something to catch
people's attention.  Skipping several releases was chosen as 
the best solution with the least overhead.  There will be no
3.0.15 - 3.0.19 ever released.  The next production release
following 3.0.20 should be 3.0.21.

The original announcement about the version number change can 
be found in the samba mailing list archives:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=samba&m=111721010206997&w=2


Asynchronous Winbind Implementation
===================================

Winbindd has been completely rewritten in this release to support
an almost completely non-blocking, asynchronous request/reply
model.  This means that winbindd will scale much better in 
large domain environments and on high latency networks.  Neither 
the client interface nor the command line tools (i.e. wbinfo) have 
changed in their calling conventions or syntax.  However, due to 
internal structure changes, it is required (more so than normal) 
that you install the nss_winbind.so library included in this release.


Support for Microsoft Print Migrator
====================================

Samba 3.0.20 includes full support for migrating printers from 
Windows servers or other Samba servers via the Microsoft Print 
Migrator tool.  Restoring printers requires a working "add printer 
command" defined in smb.conf.  Current support also allows
administrators to create a master list of printer drivers which
can be restored in bulk on new (or existing) Samba installations.


Asynchronous IO Support
=======================

Experimental support for async IO has been added to smbd for 
certain platforms.  To enable this new feature, Samba must be 
compiled to include the --with-aio-support configure option.
In addition, the "aio read size" and "aio write size" to non-zero
values.  See the smb.conf(5) man page for more details on these 
settings.

                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.12
                            Mar 18, 2005
                   ==============================

Common bugs fixed in 3.0.12 include:

  o Winbind failures when using 'disable netbios = yes'
  o Failure to establish a trust relationship via 'net rpc trust 
    establish'
  o Various portability & compiler issues.
  o Read only file deletion failure caused by new delete semantics 
    in Windows XP SP2 and the MS 04-044 security hotfix.
  o Error messages from shared Excel workbooks residing on Samba 
    file shares.
  o Missing files in the output of smbclient -c 'dir' when run 
    against Windows file servers.
  o Inability for Print Administrators to pause/resume/purge print 
    queues.

Additional features introduced in Samba 3.0.12:

  o Performance enhancements when serving directories containing 
    large number of files.
  o MS-DFS support added to smbclient.
  o More performance improvements when using Samba/OpenLDAP based 
    DC's via the 'ldapsam:trusted=yes' option.
  o Support for the Novell NDS universal password when using the
    ldapsam passdb backend.
  o New 'net rpc trustdom {add,del}' functionality to eventually 
    replace 'smbpasswd {-a,-x} -i'.
  o New libsmbclient functionality.



=======================
Large Directory Support
=======================

Samba 3.0.12pre1 introduces a specific mechanism for dealing
with file services that frequently contain a large number of files
per directory.  Historically Samba's performance has suffered 
in such environments due to the translation from case 
insensitive lookups by Windows client to the case sensitive
storage mechanisms used by UNIX filesystems.

Configuration details along with a short HOWTO can be found at:

http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/HOWTO/Samba-LargeDirectory-HOWTO


==================================
libsmbclient Binary Compatibility
==================================

Please note that a change has been made to the _SMBCCTX structure 
in source/include/libsmbclient.h.  This change is not backwards
compatible with applications linked against the libsmbclient.so
library from Samba 3.0.11.  However, it is compatible with all 
other Samba 3.0.x releases.  This means that it will be most likely
be necessary to recompile any applications linked against the 
3.0.11 version of the library.

                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.11
                             Feb 5, 2005
                   ==============================

Common bugs fixed in 3.0.11 include:

  o Crash in smbd when using CUPS printing.
  o Parsing error of other SIDs included in the user_info_3
    structure returned from domain controllers.
  o Inefficiencies when searching non-AD LDAP directories.
  o Failure to expand variables in user domain attributes
    in tdbsam and ldapsam.
  o Memory leaks.
  o Failure to retrieve certain attribute when migrating from 
    a Windows DC to a Samba DC via 'net rpc vampire'.
  o Numerous printing bugs bugs including memory 
    bloating on large/busy print servers.
  o Compatibility issues with Exchange 5.5 SP4.
  o sendfile fixes.

Additional features introduced in Samba 3.0.11:

  o Winbindd performance improvements.
  o More 'net rpc vampire' functionality.
  o Support for the Windows privilege model to assign rights
    to specific SIDs.
  o New administrative options to the 'net rpc' command.


============
LDAP Changes
============

If "ldap user suffix" or "ldap machine suffix" are defined in
smb.conf, all user-accounts must reside below the user suffix,
and all machine and inter-domain trust-accounts must be located 
below the machine suffix.  Previous Samba releases would fall 
back to searching the 'ldap suffix' in some cases.


===============
Privilege Model
===============

Samba 3.0.11 supports the following assignable rights

SeMachineAccountPrivilege  Add machines to domain
SePrintOperatorPrivilege   Manage printers
SeAddUsersPrivilege        Add users and groups to the domain
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege  Force shutdown from a remote system
SeDiskOperatorPrivilege    Manage disk shares

These rights can be assigned to arbitrary users or groups
via the 'net rpc rights grant/revoke' command.  More details
of Samba's privilege implementation can be found in the 
Samba-HOWTO-Collection.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.0.8
                             Nov 7, 2004
                   =============================

Common bugs fixed in 3.0.8 include:

  o Compile fixes for HP-UX
  o Fixes for the printer publishing code used when joined to 
    an AD domain.
  o Incompatibilities with file system quotas.
  o Several bugs in the spoolss printing code and print system 
    backends.
  o Inconsistencies in the username map functionality when 
    configured on domain member servers.
  o Various compile warnings and errors on various platforms.
  o Fixes for Kerberos interoperability with Windows 200x 
    domains when using DES keys.
  o Fix for CAN-2004-0930 -- smbd remote DoS vulnerability.
  o Fix for CAN-2004-0882 -- possible buffer overrun in smbd.

    
New features included in the 3.0.8 release are:

  o New migration functionality added the the net tool
    for files/directories, printers, and shares.
  o New experimental idmap backend for assigning uids/gids
    directly based on the user/group RID when acting as a
    member of single domain without any trusts.
  o Additional printer migration support for XP/2003 platforms.


===========================
Change in Winbindd Behavior
===========================

All usernames returned by winbindd are now converted to lower 
case for better consistency.  This means any winbind installation
relying on the winbind username will need to rename existing 
directories and/or files based on the username (%u and %U) to lower 
case (e.g. mv $name `echo $name | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`).  This may 
include mail spool files, home directories, valid user lines in 
smb.conf, etc....


======================
Change in Username Map
======================

Previous Samba releases would only support reading the fully qualified 
username (e.g. DOMAIN\user) from the username map when performing a 
Kerberos login from a client.  However, when looking up a map 
entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be
used for matches.  This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes
even on the same server.

Samba 3.0.8 obeys the following rules when applying the username
map functionality:

  * When performing local authentication, the username map is 
    applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate 
    the connection.
  * When relying upon a external domain controller for validating
    authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map 
    to the fully qualified username (i.e. DOMAIN\user) only
    after the user has been successfully authenticated.

-------

o   Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
    * Ensure extended security bit is on only if we negotiated 
      extended security.
    * Simplify statcache to use an in-memory tdb. 
    * If you're selecting a hash algorithm for tdb, you need 
      to do it at open time.
    * Removed old dir caching code - not being used now we 
      have the statcache anyway.
    * Simplify the mangle hash code to use an in-memory tdb.
    * Merge iconv changes from Samba 4 branch.

      non-Windows clients.
    * Added 'stat' command to smbclient to exercise the 
      UNIX_FILE_BASIC info level.
    * Fix bug where we could incorrectly set sparse attribute.

o   Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>
    * Avoid changing the machine account password in the passdb 
      backend, when it has 'already been changed'.  This occurs 
      in situations where the secure channel between the workstation 
      and the DC breaks down, such as occurred in the MS04-11 
      security patch.
    * Fix utility name in error message in ntlm_auth.
    * Fix NTLMv2 for use with pam_winbind.
    * Remove conversion to and from UTF8 on the winbind pipe.

      ntlm_auth.
    * Use sys_getgroups() rather than scanning all groups 
      when generating SAMR replies.


o   Igor Belyi <sambauser@katehok.ac93.org>

      qualified DOMAIN\user format for 'security = domain|ads' and 
      apply after authentication has succeeded.
    * Cosmetic fix for getent output -- lowercase the username only 
      and not the complete domain\username string.

                  =============================
                  Release Notes for Samba 3.0.6
                           Aug 19, 2004
                  =============================

Common bugs fixed in 3.0.6 include:

  o Schannel failure in winbindd.
  o Numerous memory leaks.
  o Incompatibilities between the 'write list' and 'force user'
    smb.conf options.
  o Premature optimization of the open_directory() internal 
    function that broke tools such as the ArcServe backup 
    agent, Macromedia HomeSite, and Robocopy.
  o Corrupt workgroup names in nmbd's browse.dat.
  o Sharing violation errors commonly seen when opening
    when serving Microsoft Office documents from a Samba 
    file share.
  o Browsing problems caused by an apostrophe (') in the 
    computer's description field.
  o Problems creating special file types from UNIX CIFS 
    clients and enabling 'unix extensions'.
  o Fix stalls in smbd caused by inaccessible LDAP servers.
  o Remove various memory leaks.
  o Fix issues in the password lockout feature.

New features introduced in this release include:

  O Support symlinks created by CIFS clients which 
    can be followed on the server.
  o Using a cups server other than localhost.
  o Maintaining the service principal entry in the system 
    keytab for integration with other kerberized services.
    Please refer to the 'use Kerberos keytab' entry in 
    smb.conf(5).  When using the heimdal Kerberos libraries,
    you must also specify the following in /etc/krb5.conf:
    [libdefaults]
       default_keytab_name = FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab
  o Support for maintaining individual printer names
    stored separately from the printer's sharename.
  o Support for maintaining user password history.
  o Support for honoring the logon times for user in a 
    Samba domain.


============================================
unix extensions = yes (default) and symlinks
============================================

Beginning with Samba 3.0.6pre1 (formerly known as 3.0.5pre1), 
clients supporting the UNIX extensions to the CIFS protocol 
can create symlinks to absolute paths which will be **followed** 
by the server.  This functionality has been requested in order 
to correctly support certain applications when the user's home 
directory is mounted using some type of CIFS client (e.g. the 
cifsvfs in the Linux 2.6 kernel).

If this behavior is not acceptable for your production environment
you can set 'wide links = no' in the specific share declaration in 
the server's smb.conf.  Be aware that disabling wide link support 
out of a share in Samba may impact the server's performance due 
to the fact that smbd will now have to check each path additional 
times before traversing it.
  

========================
Password History Support 
========================

The new password history feature allows smbd to check the new 
password in password change requests against a list of the user's
previous passwords.  The number of previous passwords to save can 
be set using pdbedit (4 in this example):

   root# pdbedit -P "password history" -C 4

When using the ldapsam passdb backend, it is vital to secure the 
following attributes from access by non-administrative users:

   * sambaNTPassword
   * sambaLMPassword
   * sambaPasswordHistory

You should refer to your directory server's documentation on how 
to implement this restriction.

                 Release Notes for Samba 3.0.5
                         July 20, 2004
                 =============================

Please note that Samba 3.0.5 is identical to Samba 3.0.4 with 
the exception of correcting the two security issues outlined 
below.

######################## SECURITY RELEASE ########################

Summary:       Multiple Potential Buffer Overruns in Samba 3.0.x
CVE ID:        CAN-2004-0600, CAN-2004-0686
               (http://cve.mitre.org/)


This is the latest stable release of Samba. This is the version
that production Samba servers should be running for all current
bug-fixes.

It has been confirmed that versions of Samba 3 prior to v3.0.4
are vulnerable to two potential buffer overruns.  The individual
details are given below.

=============
CAN-2004-0600
=============

Affected Versions:      Samba 3.0.2 and later

The internal routine used by the Samba Web Administration
Tool (SWAT v3.0.2 and later) to decode the base64 data
during HTTP basic authentication is subject to a buffer
overrun caused by an invalid base64 character.  It is
recommended that all Samba v3.0.2 or later installations
running SWAT either (a) upgrade to v3.0.5, or (b) disable
the swat administration service as a temporary workaround.

This same code is used internally to decode the
sambaMungedDial attribute value when using the ldapsam
passdb backend. While we do not believe that the base64
decoding routines used by the ldapsam passdb backend can
be exploited, sites using an LDAP directory service with
Samba are strongly encouraged to verify that the DIT only
allows write access to sambaSamAccount attributes by a
sufficiently authorized user.

The Samba Team would like to heartily thank Evgeny Demidov
for analyzing and reporting this bug.

-------------
CAN-2004-0686
-------------

Affected Versions:      Samba 3.0.0 and later

A buffer overrun has been located in the code used to support
the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf option.  Please be aware
that the default setting for this parameter is 'mangling method
= hash2' and therefore not vulnerable.

Affected Samba 3 installations can avoid this possible security
bug by using the default hash2 mangling method.  Server
installations requiring the hash mangling method are encouraged
to upgrade to Samba 3.0.5.

                  ==============================
                  Release Notes for Samba 3.0.2a
                        February 13, 2004
                  ==============================

Samba 3.0.2a is a minor patch release for the 3.0.2 code base
to address, in particular, a problem when using pdbedit to 
sanitize (--force-initialized-passwords) Samba's tdbsam 
backend.   This is the latest stable release of Samba. This 
is the version that all production Samba servers should be 
running for all current bug-fixes.  

******************* Attention! Achtung! Kree! *********************

Beginning with Samba 3.0.2, passwords for accounts with a last 
change time (LCT-XXX in smbpasswd, sambaPwdLastSet attribute in
ldapsam, etc...) of zero (0) will be regarded as uninitialized 
strings.  This will cause authentication to fail for such
accounts.  If you have valid passwords that meet this criteria, 
you must update the last change time to a non-zero value.  If you 
do not, then  'pdbedit --force-initialized-passwords' will disable 
these accounts and reset the password hashes to a string of X's.

******************* Attention! Achtung! Kree! *********************

                  =============================
                  Release Notes for Samba 3.0.2
                        February 9, 2004
                  =============================

It has been confirmed that previous versions of Samba 3.0 are
susceptible to a password initialization bug that could grant an 
attacker unauthorized access to a user account created by the
mksmbpasswd.sh shell script.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0082 to this issue.

Samba administrators not wishing to upgrade to the current 
version should download the 3.0.2 release, build the pdbedit 
tool, and run 

   root# pdbedit-3.0.2 --force-initialized-passwords
      
This will disable all accounts not possessing a valid password
(e.g. the password field has been set a string of X's).

Samba servers running 3.0.2 are not vulnerable to this bug 
regardless of whether or not pdbedit has been used to sanitize
the passdb backend.

Some of the more visible bugs in 3.0.1 addressed in the 3.0.2
release include:

  o Joining a Samba domain from Pre-SP2 Windows 2000 clients.
  o Logging onto a Samba domain from Windows XP clients.
  o Problems with the %U and %u smb.conf variables in relation to 
    Windows 9x/ME clients.
  o Kerberos failures due to an invalid in memory keytab detection
    test.
  o Updates to the ntlm_auth tool.
  o Fixes for various SMB signing errors.
  o Better separation of WINS and DNS queries for domain controllers.
  o Issues with nss_winbind FreeBSD and Solaris.
  o Several crash bugs in smbd and winbindd.
  o Output formatting fixes for smbclient for better compatibility
    with scripts based on the 2.2 version.

commits
-------

o   Change the interface for init_unistr2 to not take a length 
    but a flags field.  We were assuming that 
    2*strlen(mb_string) == length of ucs2-le string.  (bug 480).
o   Allow d_printf() to handle strings with escaped quotation 
    marks since the msg file includes the escape character (bug 489).

o   Fix to parse the level-2 strings.
o   Fix for "valid users = %S" in [homes].  Fix read/write 
    list as well.

    be done unconditionally (bug 550).
o   Remove duplicate smbspool link on SWAT's front page (bug 541).
o   Save and restore CFLAGS before/after AC_PROG_CC.  Ensures that
    --enable-debug=[yes|no] works correctly.
o   Allow ^C to interrupt smbpasswd if using our getpass 
    (e.g. smbpasswd command).
o   Support signing only on RPC's (bug 167).
o   Correct bug that prevented  Excel 2000 clients from opening 
    files marked as read-only.

o   Explicitly initialize the value of AR for vendor makes that don't
    do this (e.g. HPUX 11).  (bug 552).
o   More i18n fixes for SWAT (bug 413).
o   Change the cwd before the postexec script to ensure that a
    umount will succeed.

    SMB_FS_FULL_SIZE_INFORMATION (bug 564).
o   Add script to generate *msg files.
o   Add Dutch SWAT translation file.
o   Make sure to call get_user_groups() with the full winbindd 
    name for a user if he/she has one (bug 406).

    libraries were found for $BACKEND.
o   Move sysquotas autoconf tests to a separate file.
o   Match W2K w.r.t. writelock and writeclose.  Samba4 torture 
    tester
o   Make sure that the files that contain the static_init_$subsystem; 
    macro get recompiled after configure by removing the object 
    files.
o   Ensure canceling a blocking lock returns the correct error 
    message.

    the local IP address to which a client connected.
o   Allow winbindd to match local accounts to domain SID when 
    'winbind trusted domains only = yes' (bug 680).
o   Remove code in idmap_ldap that searches the user suffix and group 
    suffix.  It's not needed and provides inconsistent functionality 
    from the tdb backend.
o   Patch to handle munged dial string for Windows 2000 TSE.
    Thanks to Gaz de France, Direction de la Recherche, Service 
    Informatique Métier for their supporting this work by Aurelien 
    Degrémont <adegremont@idealx.com>.
o   Correct the "smbldap_open: cannot access when not root error"
    messages when looking up group information (bug 281).

    we add -liconv etc to LDFLAGS.
o   Fix core dump bug when "security = server" and the authentication
    server goes away.

    (bug 590).
o   Fix bug preventing print jobs from display in the queue
    monitor used by Windows NT and later clients (bug 660).
o   Fix several reported problems with point-n-print from
    Windows 2000/XP clients due to a bug in the EnumPrinterDataEx()
    reply (bug 338, 527 & 643).
o   Fix a handful of potential memory leaks in the LDAP code used
    by ldapsam[_compat] and the LDAP idmap backend.
o   Fix for pdbedit error code returns (bug 763).
o   Make sure we only enumerate group mapping entries  (not 
    /etc/group) even when doing local aliases.
o   Relax check on the pipe name in a dce/rpc bind response to work 
    around issues with establishing trusts to a Windows 2003 domain.
o   Ensure we mangle names ending in '.' in hash2 mangling method.
o   Correct parsing issues with munged dial string.
o   Fix bugs in quota support for XFS.
o   Add a cleaner method for applications that need to provide 
    name->SID mappings to do this via NSS rather than having to 
    know the winbindd pipe protocol.
o   Adds a variant of the winbindd_getgroups() call called 
    winbindd_getusersids() that provides direct SID->SIDs listing of 
    a users supplementary groups. This is enough to allow non-Samba 
    applications to do ACL checking.
o   Make sure we don't append the 'ldap suffix' when writing out the 
    'ldap XXX suffix' values in SWAT (bug 328).
o   Fix renames across file systems.
o   Ensure that items in a list of strings containing whitespace are 
    written out surrounded by single quotes.  This means that both 
    double and single quotes are now used to surround strings in 
    smb.conf (bug 481).
o   Enable SWAT to correctly determine if winbindd is running (bug 
    398).
o   Include WWW-Authenticate field in 401 response for bad auth 
    attempt (bug 629).
o   Add support for NTLM2 (NTLMv2 session security).
o   Add support for variable-length session keys.
o   More privilege fixes for group enumeration in LDAP (bug 281).
o   Use the dns name (or IP) as the originating client name when
    using CUPS (bug 467).

o   Disable NTLM2 for RPC pipes.
o   Allow the client to specify the NTLM2 flags got NTLMSSP 
    authentication.
o   Change the name of the job passed off to cups from "Test Page" 
    to "smbprn.00000033 Test Page" so that we can get the smb 
    jobid back. This allow users to delete jobs with cups printing 
    backend (partial work on bug 770).
o   Fix build of winbindd with static pdb modules.
o   Retrieve the correct ACL group bits if the file has an ACL 
    (bug 802).
o   Implement "net rpc group members": Get members of a domain group 
    in human-readable format.
o   Add MacOSX (Darwin) specific charset module code.
o   Use samr_dispinfo(level == 1) for enumerating domain users so we 
    can include the full name in gecos field (bug 587).
o   Add support for winbind's NSS library on FeeeBSD 5.1 (bug 797).
o   Implement 'net rpc group list [global|local|builtin]*' for a 
    select listing of the respective user databases.
o   Don't automatically set NT status code flag unless client tells 
    us it can cope.

    this call whether we have a complete PDU or not; fixes bug 
    with multiple PDU request rpc's broken over SMBwriteX calls 
    each.
o   Fix incorrect smb flags2 for connections to pre-NT servers 
    (causes smbclient to fail to OS2 for example) (bug 821).
o   Update version string in smbldap-tools Makefile to 0.8.2.
o   Correct a problem with "net rpc vampire" mis-parsing the 
    alias member info reply.
o   Ensure the ${libdir} is created by the installclientlib script.

######################################################################

              The original 3.0.0 release notes follow
              =======================================
                    WHATS NEW IN Samba 3.0.0
                        September 24, 2003
              =======================================


Major new features:
-------------------

1)  Active Directory support.  Samba 3.0 is now able to  
    join a ADS realm as a member server and authenticate 
    users using LDAP/Kerberos.

2)  Unicode support. Samba will now negotiate UNICODE on the wire 
    and internally there is now a much better infrastructure for 
    multi-byte and UNICODE character sets.

3)  New authentication system. The internal authentication system 
    has been almost completely rewritten. Most of the changes are 
    internal, but the new auth system is also very configurable.

4)  New default filename mangling system.

5)  A new "net" command has been added. It is somewhat similar to 
    the "net" command in windows. Eventually we plan to replace 
    numerous other utilities (such as smbpasswd) with subcommands 
    in "net".

6)  Samba now negotiates NT-style status32 codes on the wire. This
    improves error handling a lot.

7)  Better Windows 2000/XP/2003 printing support including publishing
    printer attributes in active directory.

8)  New loadable module support for passdb backends and character 
    sets.

9)  New default dual-daemon winbindd support for better performance.

10) Support for migrating from a Windows NT 4.0 domain to a Samba 
    domain and maintaining user, group and domain SIDs.

11) Support for establishing trust relationships with Windows NT 4.0
    domain controllers.
  
12) Initial support for a distributed Winbind architecture using
    an LDAP directory for storing SID to uid/gid mappings.
  
13) Major updates to the Samba documentation tree.

14) Full support for client and server SMB signing to ensure
    compatibility with default Windows 2003 security settings.

15) Improvement of ACL mapping features based on code donated by
    Andreas Grünbacher.


Plus lots of other improvements!


Additional Documentation
------------------------

Please refer to Samba documentation tree (included in the docs/ 
subdirectory) for extensive explanations of installing, configuring
and maintaining Samba 3.0 servers and clients.  It is advised to 
begin with the Samba-HOWTO-Collection for overviews and specific 
tasks (the current book is up to approximately 400 pages) and to 
refer to the various man pages for information on individual options.

We are very glad to be able to include the second edition of
"Using Samba" by Jay Ts, Robert Eckstein, and David Collier-Brown
(O'Reilly & Associates) in this release.  The book is available
on-line at http://samba.org/samba/docs/ and is included with 
the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT).  Thanks to the authors and
publisher for making "Using Samba" under the GNU Free Documentation 
License.


######################################################################
Upgrading from a previous Samba 3.0 beta
########################################

Beginning with Samba 3.0.0beta3, the RID allocation functions
have been moved into winbindd.  Previously these were handled
by each passdb backend.  This means that winbindd must be running
to automatically allocate RIDs for users and/or groups.  Otherwise,
smbd will use the 2.2 algorithm for generating new RIDs.

If you are using 'passdb backend = tdbsam' with a previous Samba 
3.0 beta release (or possibly alpha), it may be necessary to 
move the RID_COUNTER entry from /usr/local/samba/private/passdb.tdb
to winbindd_idmap.tdb.  To do this:

1)  Ensure that winbindd_idmap.tdb exists (launch winbindd at least 
    once)
2)  build tdbtool by executing 'make tdbtool' in the source/tdb/ 
    directory
3)  run: (note that 'tdb>' is the tool's prompt for input)

       root# ./tdbtool /usr/local/samba/private/passdb.tdb
       tdb> show RID_COUNTER
       key 12 bytes
       RID_COUNTER
       data 4 bytes
       [000] 0A 52 00 00                                       .R.

       tdb> move RID_COUNTER /usr/local/samba/var/locks/winbindd_idmap.tdb
       ....
       record moved

If you are using 'passdb backend = ldapsam', it will be necessary to 
store idmap entries in the LDAP directory as well (i.e. idmap backend 
= ldap).  Refer to the 'net idmap' command for more information on 
migrating SID<->UNIX id mappings from one backend to another.

If the RID_COUNTER record does not exist, then these instructions are
unneccessary and the new RID_COUNTER record will be correctly generated
if needed.  



########################

Changes in Behavior
-------------------

The following issues are known changes in behavior between Samba 2.2 and 
Samba 3.0 that may affect certain installations of Samba.

  1)  When operating as a member of a Windows domain, Samba 2.2 would 
      map any users authenticated by the remote DC to the 'guest account'
      if a uid could not be obtained via the getpwnam() call.  Samba 3.0
      rejects the connection as NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE.  There is no 
      current work around to re-establish the 2.2 behavior.
      
  2)  When adding machines to a Samba 2.2 controlled domain, the 
      'add user script' was used to create the UNIX identity of the 
      machine trust account.  Samba 3.0 introduces a new 'add machine 
      script' that must be specified for this purpose.  Samba 3.0 will
      not fall back to using the 'add user script' in the absence of 
      an 'add machine script'
  

######################################################################
Passdb Backends and Authentication
##################################

There have been a few new changes that Samba administrators should be
aware of when moving to Samba 3.0.

  1) encrypted passwords have been enabled by default in order to 
     inter-operate better with out-of-the-box Windows client 
     installations.  This does mean that either (a) a samba account
     must be created for each user, or (b) 'encrypt passwords = no'
     must be explicitly defined in smb.conf.
    
  2) Inclusion of new 'security = ads' option for integration 
     with an Active Directory domain using the native Windows
     Kerberos 5 and LDAP protocols.

     MIT Kerberos 1.3.1 supports the ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 encryption 
     type which is neccessary for servers on which the 
     administrator password has not been changed, or Kerberos-enabled 
     SMB connections to servers that require Kerberos SMB signing.
     Besides this one difference, either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos
     distributions are usable by Samba 3.0.
     

Samba 3.0 also includes the possibility of setting up chains
of authentication methods (auth methods) and account storage 
backends (passdb backend).  Please refer to the smb.conf(5) 
man page for details.  While both parameters assume sane default 
values, it is likely that you will need to understand what the 
values actually mean in order to ensure Samba operates correctly.

The recommended passdb backends at this time are

  * smbpasswd - 2.2 compatible flat file format
  * tdbsam - attribute rich database intended as an smbpasswd
    replacement for stand alone servers
  * ldapsam - attribute rich account storage and retrieval 
    backend utilizing an LDAP directory.  
  * ldapsam_compat - a 2.2 backward compatible LDAP account 
    backend
    
Certain functions of the smbpasswd(8) tool have been split between the 
new smbpasswd(8) utility, the net(8) tool, and the new pdbedit(8) 
utility.  See the respective man pages for details.
    
     
######################################################################
LDAP
####

This section outlines the new features affecting Samba / LDAP 
integration.

New Schema
----------
  
A new object class (sambaSamAccount) has been introduced to replace 
the old sambaAccount.  This change aids us in the renaming of 
attributes to prevent clashes with attributes from other vendors.  
There is a conversion script (examples/LDAP/convertSambaAccount) to 
modify and LDIF file to the new schema.
  
Example:
  
  $ ldapsearch .... -b "ou=people,dc=..." > sambaAcct.ldif
  $ convertSambaAccount --sid=<Domain SID> \
    --input=sambaAcct.ldif --output=sambaSamAcct.ldif \
    --changetype=[modify|add]
	
The <DOM SID> can be obtained by running 'net getlocalsid 
<DOMAINNAME>' on the Samba PDC as root.  The changetype determines 
the format of the generated LDIF output--either create new entries 
or modify existing entries.
    
The old sambaAccount schema may still be used by specifying the 
"ldapsam_compat" passdb backend.  However, the sambaAccount and
associated attributes have been moved to the historical section of
the schema file and must be uncommented before use if needed.
The 2.2 object class declaration for a sambaAccount has not changed
in the 3.0 samba.schema file. 
  
Other new object classes and their uses include:
  
  * sambaDomain - domain information used to allocate rids 
    for users and groups as necessary.  The attributes are added
    in 'ldap suffix' directory entry automatically if 
    an idmap uid/gid range has been set and the 'ldapsam'
    passdb backend has been selected.
      
  * sambaGroupMapping - an object representing the 
    relationship between a posixGroup and a Windows
    group/SID.  These entries are stored in the 'ldap 
    group suffix' and managed by the 'net groupmap' command.
    
  * sambaUnixIdPool - created in the 'ldap idmap suffix' entry 
    automatically and contains the next available 'idmap uid' and 
    'idmap gid'
    
  * sambaIdmapEntry - object storing a mapping between a 
    SID and a UNIX uid/gid.  These objects are created by the 
    idmap_ldap module as needed.

  * sambaSidEntry - object representing a SID alone, as a Structural
    class on which to build the sambaIdmapEntry.

    
New Suffix for Searching
------------------------
  
The following new smb.conf parameters have been added to aid in directing
certain LDAP queries when 'passdb backend = ldapsam://...' has been
specified.

  * ldap suffix         - used to search for user and computer accounts
  * ldap user suffix    - used to store user accounts
  * ldap machine suffix - used to store machine trust accounts
  * ldap group suffix   - location of posixGroup/sambaGroupMapping entries
  * ldap idmap suffix   - location of sambaIdmapEntry objects

If an 'ldap suffix' is defined, it will be appended to all of the 
remaining sub-suffix parameters.  In this case, the order of the suffix
listings in smb.conf is important.  Always place the 'ldap suffix' first
in the list.  

Due to a limitation in Samba's smb.conf parsing, you should not surround 
the DN's with quotation marks.


IdMap LDAP support
------------------

Samba 3.0 supports an ldap backend for the idmap subsystem.  The 
following options would inform Samba that the idmap table should be
stored on the directory server onterose in the "ou=idmap,dc=plainjoe,
dc=org" partition.

 [global]
    ...
    idmap backend     = ldap:ldap://onterose/
    ldap idmap suffix = ou=idmap,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
    idmap uid         = 40000-50000
    idmap gid         = 40000-50000

This configuration allows winbind installations on multiple servers to
share a uid/gid number space, thus avoiding the interoperability problems
with NFS that were present in Samba 2.2.
    


######################################################################
Trust Relationships and a Samba Domain
######################################

Samba 3.0.0beta2 is able to utilize winbindd as the means of 
allocating uids and gids to trusted users and groups.  More
information regarding Samba's support for establishing trust 
relationships can be found in the Samba-HOWTO-Collection included
in the docs/ directory of this release.

First create your Samba PDC and ensure that everything is 
working correctly before moving on the trusts.

To establish Samba as the trusting domain (named SAMBA) from a Windows NT
4.0 domain named WINDOWS:

  1) create the trust account for SAMBA in "User Manager for Domains"
  2) connect the trust from the Samba domain using
     'net rpc trustdom establish GLASS'

To create a trustlationship with SAMBA as the trusted domain:

  1) create the initial trust account for GLASS using
     'smbpasswd -a -i GLASS'.  You may need to create a UNIX
     account for GLASS$ prior to this step (depending on your
     local configuration).
  2) connect the trust from a WINDOWS DC using "User Manager
     for Domains"

Now join winbindd on the Samba PDC to the SAMBA domain using
the normal steps for adding a Samba server to an NT4 domain:
(note that smbd & nmbd must be running at this point)

   root# net rpc join -U root
   Password: <enter root password from smbpasswd file here>

Start winbindd and test the join with 'wbinfo -t'.

Now test the trust relationship by connecting to the SAMBA DC
(e.g. POGO) as a user from the WINDOWS domain:

   $ smbclient //pogo/netlogon -U Administrator -W WINDOWS
   Password:

Now connect to the WINDOWS DC (e.g. CRYSTAL) as a Samba user:

   $ smbclient //crystal/netlogon -U root -W WINDOWS
   Password:

######################################################################
Changes in Winbind
##################

Beginning with Samba3.0.0beta3, winbindd has been given new account
manage functionality equivalent to the 'add user script' family of
smb.conf parameters.  The idmap design has also been changed to 
centralize control of foreign SID lookups and matching to UNIX 
uids and gids.


Brief Description of Changes
----------------------------

1) The sid_to_uid() family of functions (smbd/uid.c) have been 
   reverted to the 2.2.x design.  This means that when resolving a 
   SID to a UID or similar mapping:

        a) First consult winbindd
        b) perform a local lookup only if winbindd fails to
           return a successful answer

   There are some variations to this, but these two rules generally
   apply.

2) All idmap lookups have been moved into winbindd.  This means that
   a server must run winbindd (and support NSS) in order to achieve
   any mappings of SID to dynamically allocated UNIX ids.  This was
   a conscious design choice.

3) (OBSOLETE) New functions have been added to winbindd to emulate 
   the 'add user script' family of smbd functions without requiring 
   that external scripts be defined.  This functionality is controlled 
   by the 'winbind  enable local accounts' smb.conf parameter (enabled 
   by default).

   However, this account management functionality is only supported 
   in a local tdb (winbindd_idmap.tdb).  If these new UNIX accounts 
   must be shared among multiple Samba servers (such as a PDC and BDCs), 
   it will be necessary to define your own 'add user script', et. al.
   programs that place the accounts/groups in some form of directory
   such as NIS or LDAP.  This requirement was deemed beyond the scope
   of winbind's account management functions.  Solutions for 
   distributing UNIX system information have been deployed and tested 
   for many years.  We saw no need to reinvent the wheel.

4) A member of a Samba controlled domain running winbindd is now able 
   to map domain users directly onto existing UNIX accounts while still
   automatically creating accounts for trusted users and groups.  This
   behavior is controlled by the 'winbind trusted domains only' smb.conf
   parameter (disabled by default to provide 2.2.x winbind behavior).

5) Group mapping support is wrapped in the local_XX_to_XX() functions
   in smbd/uid.c.  The reason that group mappings are not included
   in winbindd is because the purpose of Samba's group map is to
   match any Windows SID with an existing UNIX group.  These UNIX
   groups can be created by winbindd (see next section), but the
   SID<->gid mapping is retreived by smbd, not winbindd.


Examples
--------

* security = server running winbindd to allocate accounts on demand

* Samba PDC running winbindd to handle the automatic creation of UNIX
  identities for machine trust accounts

* Automtically creating UNIX user and groups when migrating a Windows NT
  4.0 PDC to a Samba PDC.  Winbindd must be running when executing
  'net rpc vampire' for this to work.
