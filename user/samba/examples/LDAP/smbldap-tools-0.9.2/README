What those tools are for?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

A collection of scripts, «over» user{add,del,mod} and group{add,del,mod}
system tools to manipulate users and groups stored in LDAP directory,
for DEN system like SAMBA-LDAP and pam/nss_ldap systems.

Additionnaly, some scripts are designed to ease your migration from
a Windows NT 4.0 PDC Server to a Samba-LDAP PDC Server (Killer?;-):
smbldap-populate, smbldap-migrate-groups, smbldap-migrate-accounts.

They are currently used with Samba 2.2.4, therefore you may (will) have
to make some fixes for Samba TNG and Samba 3.0. Hint: contribs welcome :)

In the future, some other function may come (like backup and restore,
Novell migration tools, samba system activity report, dealing with
mail functions, compliance to RFC2307...): consult TODO.


What do SMBLDAP-TOOLS provide?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Those tools provide the following functions :
 . populate LDAP database with a basic LDIF
 . add a user or group
 . delete a user or group
 . modify all users or groups data (all attributes types stored in
   posixAccount and sambaAccount object class)
Taking care of :
 . staying compatible with all standard system tools options
   (user/group{add,del,mod})
 . be extensible for future developments
   (manipulation of shadow account options, for example)
 . error management, in the way system tools do
Constraints :
 . usage of PERL (portability)
 . all options must be placed in an external configuration file
 . english localization

The current release uses the "mkntpwd" program, in mkntpwd.tar.gz
in the current directory. It comes from
http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~aperrin/tips/src/mkntpwd.tar.gz
It allows to not use smbpasswd (if $with_smbpasswd == 0 in smbldap_conf.pm)

What do SMBLDAP-TOOLS deliver?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Contents :
 . scripts (see FILES)
 . user documentation in pod format, included in the sources
   (or just use the -? option)

These tools aim at delivering the same functionality as the corresponding
system tools. However they may not be all implemented yet.
Current limitations :
 . no shadow support
 . cannot change uid with usermod
 . no UTF-8 support (thus ASCII-7 only)


How to generate documentation?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Just issue the following command:
 perldoc name_of_script.pl (ex: perldoc smbldap-useradd.pl)

Where can I find the latest release of those scripts?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Just fire any web browser to http://samba.IDEALX.org/
and/or contact samba@IDEALX.org

Additionnaly, you will find an useful Webmin module
at http://webmin.IDEALX.org/ if interested in a graphical 
user interface to manager user and groups accounts via Webmin
for your Samba+LDAP PDC.

Let us know if these tools helped you, or if we should enhance
them with some functions you want them to support.

Sincerly,
	LEM
