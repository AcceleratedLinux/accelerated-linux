<h1 class="head0">Appendix A. Example Configuration Files</h1>


<p>Earlier in this book, we provided information on how to set
parameters inside the Samba configuration file, but rarely have we
shown an example of a complete file that can actually be used to run
a server. In this appendix, we provide examples of complete
configuration files for running Samba in the various modes
we've discussed. Using one of these examples, you
can run Samba as a workgroup authentication server, workgroup server,
primary domain controller, or domain member server.</p>

<p>We have kept the examples simple so that they have the most universal
application. They can be used as starting templates, which you can
easily modify to fit your own needs, to get a Samba server up and
running with minimal delay. The comments inside the files indicate
what needs to be changed, and how, to work on a particular system on
your network.</p>



<div class="sect1"><a name="samba2-APP-A-SECT-1"/>

<h2 class="head1">Samba in a Workgroup</h2>

<p>If your network is configured as a workgroup, adding a Samba server
is pretty simple. Samba even lets you add features, such as
user-level security and WINS, that would normally require an
expensive Windows NT/2000 Server.</p>


<div class="sect2"><a name="samba2-APP-A-SECT-1.1"/>

<h3 class="head2">Authentication and WINS Server</h3>

<p>In a workgroup environment, Samba can be set up with share-level
security and without offering WINS name service. This works and is
simple, but we generally recommend that user-level security be
enabled to allow Windows 95/98/Me systems to make use of it. Also, it
only takes a single parameter to enable Samba as a WINS server,
resulting in far better network efficiency.
<a name="INDEX-1"/><a name="INDEX-2"/><a name="INDEX-3"/>Here is the configuration file
that does it:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[global]
    # replace &quot;toltec&quot; with your system's hostname

    netbios name = toltec

    # replace &quot;METRAN&quot; with the name of your workgroup

    workgroup = METRAN

    security = user
    encrypt passwords = yes

    # Run a WINS server

    wins support = yes

    # The following three lines ensure that the Samba
    # server will maintain the role of master browser.
    # Make sure no other Samba server has its OS level
    # set higher than it is here.

    local master = yes
    preferred master = yes
    os level = 65

# Make home directories on the server available to users.

[homes]
    comment = %u's Home Directory
    browsable = no
    read only = no
    map archive = yes

# This is a shared directory, accessible by all
# users. Use your own share name and path.

[d]
    path = /d
    create mask = 0700
    read only = no</pre></blockquote>

<p>Generally, you will use a configuration file similar to this one when
<a name="INDEX-4"/><a name="INDEX-5"/>adding your first Samba server to the
workgroup.</p>

<div class="sect2"><a name="samba2-APP-A-SECT-1.2"/>

<h3 class="head2">Workgroup Server</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-6"/><a name="INDEX-7"/>Things are a
little different if another system&mdash;either a Samba server or
Windows NT/2000 server&mdash;is already handling WINS and/or
authentication. In this case, Samba is configured to use that server
for WINS. Here is a configuration file that does this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[global]
    # replace &quot;mixtec&quot; with your system's hostname

    netbios name = mixtec

    # replace &quot;METRAN&quot; with your workgroup name

    workgroup = METRAN

    security = user
    encrypt passwords = yes

    # Replace &quot;172.16.1.1&quot; with the IP address
    # of your WINS server. If there is none,
    # omit this line.

    wins server = 172.16.1.1

    # The OS level is set to 17 to allow
    # this system to win over all Windows
    # versions, but not the Samba server 
    # that uses the configuration file
    # in the previous section.

    os level = 17

[homes]
    comment = %u's Home Directory
    browsable = no
    read only = no

# This is a shared directory, accessible by all
# users. Use your own share name and path.

[d]
    path = /d
    create mask = 0700
    read only = no</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once you have a server in your workgroup handling authentication and
WINS, this is the configuration file to use when adding additional
Samba servers to the workgroup.</p>

<h2 class="head1">Samba in a Windows NT Domain</h2>

<p>When operating in a Windows NT domain, Samba can act either as a
primary domain controller or as a domain member server.</p>


<div class="sect2"><a name="samba2-APP-A-SECT-2.1"/>

<h3 class="head2">Primary Domain Controller</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-8"/><a name="INDEX-9"/>Setting up Samba as a primary domain
controller is more complicated than the other configurations.
However, the extra difficulty is offset by having a more secure
network and additional features such as logon scripts and roaming
profiles. In the following configuration file, we also include
support for a Microsoft Dfs share:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[global]
    # Replace &quot;toltec&quot; with the hostname of your system.

    netbios name = toltec

    # Replace &quot;METRAN&quot; with the name of your Windows NT domain.

    workgroup = METRAN

    # Run a WINS server

    wins support = yes
    
    # Always act as the local master browser
    # and domain master browser.  Do not allow
    # any other system to take over these roles!

    domain master = yes
    local master = yes
    preferred master = yes
    os level = 255

    # Perform domain authentication.

    security = user
    encrypt passwords = yes
    domain logons = yes
    
    # The location of user profiles for Windows NT/2000/XP.

    logon path = \\%L\profiles\%u\%m

    # Users' Windows home directories and storage of Win95/98/Me roaming profiles.

    logon drive = G:
    logon home = \\toltec\%u\.win_profile\%m

    # The following line is optional because
    # Samba always offers NetBIOS time service.
    # This causes it to also be advertised:

    time server = yes

    # The logon script used for all users,
    # Relative to [netlogon] share directory.

    logon script = logon.bat

    # The group identifying administrative users.
    # If you have domain users in the Domain Admins
    # group, use them here instead of &quot;jay&quot;.

    domain admin group = root jay

    # For adding machine accounts automatically.
    # This example works on Linux. For other host
    # operating systems, you might need a different
    # command.

    add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /dev/null -g 100 -s /bin/false -M %u

    # Provide Microsoft Dfs support.

    host msdfs = yes
