<h1 class="head0">Appendix D. Downloading Samba with CVS</h1>


<p>In <a href="ch02.html">Chapter 2</a> we showed you how to download the
latest stable version of Samba published by the Samba developers. For
most purposes (including virtually all production servers) this
procedure will meet your needs. However, sometimes you might want to
run a version of Samba that includes the latest bug fixes and
features, maybe for research and testing purposes, or just to see
what the Samba developers have been up to lately.</p>

<p>The Samba team keeps the latest updates of the Samba source code in a
<a name="INDEX-1"/><a name="INDEX-2"/>Concurrent Versions System
(CVS) repository. CVS is a freely available
<a name="INDEX-3"/>configuration management tool
and is distributed under the GNU General Public License. You can
download the latest copy from <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">http://www.cvshome.org/</a>. The Samba team
describes various ways to access its CVS repository at <a href="http://www.samba.org/samba/cvs.html">http://www.samba.org/samba/cvs.html</a>.</p>

<a name="samba2-APP-D-NOTE-162"/><blockquote class="note"><h4 class="objtitle">WARNING</h4>
<p>Although the CVS code contains the latest features, it also contains
the latest bugs and sometimes won't even compile
properly! If you prefer a less &quot;bleeding
edge&quot; release, try looking in the
<em class="filename">alpha</em> and <em class="filename">pre</em> directories
on the Samba FTP server. The <em class="filename">alpha</em> directory
contains alpha releases, and the <em class="emphasis">pre</em> directory
contains (usually more stable) prerelease versions. (See <a href="ch02.html">Chapter 2</a> for information on downloading via FTP.) Alpha
releases might be a little behind the latest CVS code, but are less
buggy and usually compile properly on the more common Unix versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the nicest things about CVS is its ability to handle remote
logins. This means that people across the globe on the Internet can
download and update various source files for any project that uses a
CVS repository. Such is the case with Samba. Once you have CVS
installed on your system, you must first log in to the Samba source
server with the following command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot login</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>When you are prompted for a password, enter <tt class="literal">cvs</tt>.
You are connected to the CVS server at
<tt class="literal">pserver.samba.org</tt>. Once you are connected, you can
download the latest source tree with the following command:<a name="FNPTR-1"/><a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>cvs -z5 -d :pserver:pserver@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot co samba</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>This downloads the entire Samba distribution (file by file) into a
directory called <em class="filename">samba</em>, created in your current
directory. The <em class="filename">samba</em> directory has the same
structure as the Samba source distribution described in <a href="ch02.html">Chapter 2</a>, except that it has additional directories
named <em class="filename">CVS</em> throughout the source tree. These
directories are used by CVS to store information about each file in
the source tree and how to update them. After the download is
completed, you can follow the instructions in <a href="ch02.html">Chapter 2</a> to configure, compile, and install your new
Samba release.</p>

<p>The Samba developers typically update the Samba source code one or
more times per day. Whenever you want to catch up to the latest
changes, simply <em class="emphasis">cd</em> to the
<em class="filename">samba</em> directory and run the following command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>cvs update -d -P</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Each time you do this, you will need to reconfigure, recompile, and
reinstall to update your installation as we showed you in <a href="ch02.html">Chapter 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#FNPTR-1">[1]</a> The <tt class="literal">-z</tt> option causes the transfer to be made
in GNU gzip compressed format and requires the
<em class="filename">gzip</em> program to be installed on your system to
work. If you do not have <em class="filename">gzip</em>, omit the
<tt class="literal">-z</tt> option.</p> </blockquote><hr/><h4 class="head4"><a href="toc.html">TOC</a></h4>
