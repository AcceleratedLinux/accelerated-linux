It
is usually invoked indirectly by
the <a href="mount.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span></a> command when using the 
"-t cifs" option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must
support the cifs filesystem. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the 
SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and many other
commercial servers and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as 
by the popular Open Source server Samba.

	The mount.cifs utility attaches the UNC name (exported network resource) to
	the local directory <span class="emphasis"><em>mount-point</em></span>. It is possible to set the mode for mount.cifs to 
setuid root to allow non-root users to mount shares to directories for which they
have write permission.
	</p><p>
		Options to <span class="emphasis"><em>mount.cifs</em></span> are specified as a comma-separated
list of key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other
than those listed here, assuming that the cifs filesystem kernel module (cifs.ko) supports them.   
Unrecognized cifs mount options passed to the cifs vfs kernel code will be logged to the
kernel log.

	</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>mount.cifs</em></span> causes the cifs vfs to launch a thread named cifsd. After mounting it keeps running until

                (writebehind) through the local Linux client pagecache
                if oplock (caching token) is granted and held. Note that
                direct allows write operations larger than page size

The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading 
debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem.
In the directory <code class="filename">/proc/fs/cifs</code> are various 
configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information.  
There are additional startup options such as maximum buffer size and number
of buffers which only may be set when the kernel cifs vfs (cifs.ko module) is 
loaded.  These can be seen by running the modinfo utility against the file
cifs.ko which will list the options that may be passed to cifs during module
installation (device driver load).
For more information see the kernel file <code class="filename">fs/cifs/README</code>.
