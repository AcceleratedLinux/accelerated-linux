		cause names to be resolved as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><code class="constant">lmhosts</code>: Lookup an IP

			name to IP address resolution, using the system <code class="filename">/etc/hosts
			</code>, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution 
			is operating system dependent, for instance on IRIX or Solaris this 
			may be controlled by the <code class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> 
			file).  Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name 
			type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise 
			it is ignored.</p></li><li><p><code class="constant">wins</code>: Query a name with 
			the IP address listed in the <em class="parameter"><code>wins server</code></em>
			parameter.  If no WINS server has
			been specified this method will be ignored.</p></li><li><p><code class="constant">bcast</code>: Do a broadcast on 
			each of the known local interfaces listed in the

			connected subnet.</p></li></ul></div><p>If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order

		mput commands. </p><p>The masks specified to the mget and mput commands act as 
		filters for directories rather than files when recursion is 
		toggled ON. </p><p>The mask specified with the mask command is necessary 
		to filter files within those directories. For example, if the
		mask specified in an mget command is "source*" and the mask 
		specified with the mask command is "*.c" and recursion is 
		toggled ON, the mget command will retrieve all files matching 
		"*.c" in all directories below and including all directories 
		matching "source*" in the current working directory. </p><p>Note that the value for mask defaults to blank (equivalent 
		to "*") and remains so until the mask command is used to change it. 
		It retains the most recently specified value indefinitely. To

		the mask command will be retrieved. See also the mask command. 
		</p><p>When recursion is toggled OFF, only files from the current

		permissions, inode number, number of links and finally the three timestamps
		(access, modify and change). If the file is a special file (symlink, character or

		UNIX extensions and will fail if the server does not. The client requests that the server
		create a symbolic hard link between the target and linkname files. The linkname file
		must not exist. Note that the server will not create a link to any path that lies 
		outside the currently connected share. This is enforced by the Samba server.

	passwords, share names (AKA service names) and machine names. 
	If you fail to connect try giving all parameters in uppercase. 
	</p><p>It is often necessary to use the -n option when connecting 
	to some types of servers. For example OS/2 LanManager insists 
	on a valid NetBIOS name being used, so you need to supply a valid 
	name that would be known to the server.</p><p>smbclient supports long file names where the server 
	supports the LANMAN2 protocol or above. </p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id302291"></a><h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2><p>The variable <code class="envar">USER</code> may contain the 
	username of the person  using the client. This information is 
	used only if the protocol  level is high enough to support 
	session-level passwords.</p><p>The variable <code class="envar">PASSWD</code> may contain 
	the password of the person using the client.  This information is 
	used only if the protocol level is high enough to support 
	session-level passwords. </p><p>The variable <code class="envar">LIBSMB_PROG</code> may contain 
	the path, executed with system(), which the client should connect 
        to instead of connecting to a server.  This functionality is primarily

        file</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id302324"></a><h2>INSTALLATION</h2><p>The location of the client program is a matter for 
	individual system administrators. The following are thus
	suggestions only. </p><p>It is recommended that the smbclient software be installed
	in the <code class="filename">/usr/local/samba/bin/</code> or <code class="filename">
	/usr/samba/bin/</code> directory, this directory readable 
	by all, writeable only by root. The client program itself should 
	be executable by all. The client should <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> be 
	setuid or setgid! </p><p>The client log files should be put in a directory readable 
	and writeable only by the user. </p><p>To test the client, you will need to know the name of a 
	running SMB/CIFS server. It is possible to run <a href="smbd.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smbd</span>(8)</span></a> as an ordinary user - running that server as a daemon 
	on a user-accessible port (typically any port number over 1024)
	would provide a suitable test server. </p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id302373"></a><h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2><p>Most diagnostics issued by the client are logged in a 
	specified log file. The log file name is specified at compile time, 
	but may be overridden on the command line. </p><p>The number and nature of diagnostics available depends 
	on the debug level used by the client. If you have problems, 
	set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files. </p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id302389"></a><h2>VERSION</h2><p>This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id302400"></a><h2>AUTHOR</h2><p>The original Samba software and related utilities

	excellent piece of Open Source software, available at <a href="ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/" target="_top">
	ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/</a>) and updated for the Samba 2.0
