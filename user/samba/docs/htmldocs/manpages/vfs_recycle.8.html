	<a href="samba.7.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">samba</span>(7)</span></a> suite.</p><p>The <span><strong class="command">vfs_recycle</strong></span> intercepts file deletion
	requests and moves the affected files to a temporary repository
	rather than deleting them immediately. This gives the same effect
	as the Recycle Bin on Windows computers. </p><p>The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer
	views of the network file system (share) nor on any mapped
	drive. Instead, a directory called .recycle will be automatically
	created when the first file is deleted and recycle:repository is
	not configured. If recycle:repository is configured, the name
	of the created directory depends on recycle:repository. Users
	can recover files from the recycle bin. If the recycle:keeptree
	option has been specified, deleted files will be found in a path
	identical with that from which the file was deleted.  </p><p>This module is stackable.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id259546"></a><h2>OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">recycle:repository = PATH</span></dt><dd><p>Path of the directory where deleted files should be moved.
