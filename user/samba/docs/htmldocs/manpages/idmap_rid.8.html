			Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
			backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter.
			If algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the
			range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is discarded.
			It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
			between local and remotely defined IDs.

			Defines the base integer used to build SIDs out of an UID or a GID,
			and to rebase the UID or GID to be obtained from a SID. User RIDs
			by default start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal), this means a good value
			for base_rid can be 1000 as the resulting ID is calculated this way:
			ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW RANGE ID.
