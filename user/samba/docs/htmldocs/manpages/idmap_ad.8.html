	id mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema
	extensions. This module implements only the "idmap"
	API, and is READONLY. Mappings must be provided in advance
	by the administrator by adding the posixAccount/posixGroup
	classess and relative attribute/value pairs to the users and
	groups objects in AD</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id291819"></a><h2>IDMAP OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">range = low - high</span></dt><dd><p>
			Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
			backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter.
			If specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the
			range is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded.
			It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
			between local and remotely defined IDs.

	The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal and
	and trusted AD domains. All is needed is to set default to yes. If trusted
	domains are present id conflicts must be resolved beforehand, there is no
	guarantee on the order confliting mappings would be resolved at this point.

	This example also shows how to leave a small non conflicting range for local
	id allocation that may be used in internal backends like BULTIN.

	The original Samba software and related utilities 
	were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
	by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
	to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
