.SH "NAME"
ntlm_auth - tool to allow external access to Winbind's NTLM authentication function
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 10
\fBntlm_auth\fR [-d debuglevel] [-l logdir] [-s <smb config file>]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite.
.PP
\fBntlm_auth\fR
is a helper utility that authenticates users using NT/LM authentication. It returns 0 if the users is authenticated successfully and 1 if access was denied. ntlm_auth uses winbind to access the user and authentication data for a domain. This utility is only indended to be used by other programs (currently
Squid
and
mod_ntlm_winbind)
.SH "OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS"
.PP
The
\fBwinbindd\fR(8)
daemon must be operational for many of these commands to function.
.PP
Some of these commands also require access to the directory
\fIwinbindd_privileged\fR
in
\fI$LOCKDIR\fR. This should be done either by running this command as root or providing group access to the
\fIwinbindd_privileged\fR
directory. For security reasons, this directory should not be world-accessable.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
--helper-protocol=PROTO
.RS 3n
Operate as a stdio-based helper. Valid helper protocols are:

.RS 3n
.PP
squid-2.4-basic
.RS 3n
Server-side helper for use with Squid 2.4's basic (plaintext) authentication.
.RE
.PP
squid-2.5-basic
.RS 3n
Server-side helper for use with Squid 2.5's basic (plaintext) authentication.
.RE
.PP
squid-2.5-ntlmssp
.RS 3n
Server-side helper for use with Squid 2.5's NTLMSSP authentication.
.sp
Requires access to the directory
\fIwinbindd_privileged\fR
in
\fI$LOCKDIR\fR. The protocol used is described here:
http://devel.squid-cache.org/ntlm/squid_helper_protocol.html. This protocol has been extended to allow the NTLMSSP Negotiate packet to be included as an argument to the
\fBYR\fR
command. (Thus avoiding loss of information in the protocol exchange).
.RE
.PP
ntlmssp-client-1
.RS 3n
Client-side helper for use with arbitary external programs that may wish to use Samba's NTLMSSP authentication knowlege.
.sp
This helper is a client, and as such may be run by any user. The protocol used is effectivly the reverse of the previous protocol. A
\fBYR\fR
command (without any arguments) starts the authentication exchange.
.RE
.PP
gss-spnego
.RS 3n
Server-side helper that implements GSS-SPNEGO. This uses a protocol that is almost the same as
\fBsquid-2.5-ntlmssp\fR, but has some subtle differences that are undocumented outside the source at this stage.
.sp
Requires access to the directory
\fIwinbindd_privileged\fR
in
\fI$LOCKDIR\fR.
.RE
.PP
gss-spnego-client
.RS 3n
Client-side helper that implements GSS-SPNEGO. This also uses a protocol similar to the above helpers, but is currently undocumented.
.RE
.PP
ntlm-server-1
.RS 3n
Server-side helper protocol, intended for use by a RADIUS server or the 'winbind' plugin for pppd, for the provision of MSCHAP and MSCHAPv2 authentication.
.sp
This protocol consists of lines in for form:
\fBParameter: value\fR
and
\fBParamter:: Base64-encode value\fR. The presence of a single period
\fB.\fR
indicates that one side has finished supplying data to the other. (Which in turn could cause the helper to authenticate the user).
.sp
Curently implemented parameters from the external program to the helper are:

.RS 3n
.PP
Username
.RS 3n
The username, expected to be in Samba's
unix charset.
.sp
\fBExample 1. \fRUsername: bob
.sp
\fBExample 2. \fRUsername:: Ym9i
.RE
.PP
Username
.RS 3n
The user's domain, expected to be in Samba's
unix charset.
.sp
\fBExample 3. \fRDomain: WORKGROUP
.sp
\fBExample 4. \fRDomain:: V09SS0dST1VQ
.RE
.PP
Full-Username
.RS 3n
The fully qualified username, expected to be in Samba's

and qualified with the
winbind separator.
.sp
\fBExample 5. \fRFull-Username: WORKGROUP\bob
.sp
\fBExample 6. \fRFull-Username:: V09SS0dST1VQYm9i
.RE
.PP
LANMAN-Challenge
.RS 3n
The 8 byte
\fBLANMAN Challenge\fR
value, generated randomly by the server, or (in cases such as MSCHAPv2) generated in some way by both the server and the client.
.sp
\fBExample 7. \fRLANMAN-Challege: 0102030405060708
.RE
.PP
LANMAN-Response
.RS 3n
The 24 byte
\fBLANMAN Response\fR
value, calculated from the user's password and the supplied
\fBLANMAN Challenge\fR. Typically, this is provided over the network by a client wishing to authenticate.
.sp
\fBExample 8. \fRLANMAN-Response: 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F101112131415161718
.RE
.PP
NT-Response
.RS 3n
The >= 24 byte
\fBNT Response\fR
calculated from the user's password and the supplied
\fBLANMAN Challenge\fR. Typically, this is provided over the network by a client wishing to authenticate.
.sp
\fBExample 9. \fRNT-Response: 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F101112131415161718
.RE
.PP
Password
.RS 3n
The user's password. This would be provided by a network client, if the helper is being used in a legacy situation that exposes plaintext passwords in this way.
.sp
\fBExample 10. \fRPassword: samba2
.sp
\fBExample 11. \fRPassword:: c2FtYmEy
.RE
.PP
Request-User-Session-Key
.RS 3n
Apon sucessful authenticaiton, return the user session key associated with the login.
.sp
\fBExample 12. \fRRequest-User-Session-Key: Yes
.RE
.PP
Request-LanMan-Session-Key
.RS 3n
Apon sucessful authenticaiton, return the LANMAN session key associated with the login.
.sp
\fBExample 13. \fRRequest-LanMan-Session-Key: Yes

\fBWarning\fR
Implementors should take care to base64 encode
		any data (such as usernames/passwords) that may contain malicous user data, such as
		a newline.  They may also need to decode strings from
		the helper, which likewise may have been base64 encoded.

-s <configuration file>
.RS 3n
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
\fIsmb.conf\fR
for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.
.RE
.PP
-d|--debuglevel=level
.RS 3n
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

parameter in the
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file.
.RE
.PP
-l|--logfile=logdirectory
.RS 3n
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
\fB".progname"\fR
will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.
.RE
.PP
-h|--help
.RS 3n
Print a summary of command line options.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE SETUP"
.PP
To setup ntlm_auth for use by squid 2.5, with both basic and NTLMSSP authentication, the following should be placed in the
\fIsquid.conf\fR
file.

.sp

.nf

auth_param ntlm program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp
auth_param basic program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic
auth_param basic children 5
auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours

.fi

.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
\fBNote\fR
.PP
This example assumes that ntlm_auth has been installed into your path, and that the group permissions on
\fIwinbindd_privileged\fR
are as described above.
.PP
To setup ntlm_auth for use by squid 2.5 with group limitation in addition to the above example, the following should be added to the
\fIsquid.conf\fR
file.

.sp

.nf

auth_param ntlm program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --require-membership-of='WORKGROUP\Domain Users'
auth_param basic program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic --require-membership-of='WORKGROUP\Domain Users'

.fi

.SH "TROUBLESHOOTING"
.PP
If you're experiencing problems with authenticating Internet Explorer running under MS Windows 9X or Millenium Edition against ntlm_auth's NTLMSSP authentication helper (--helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp), then please read
the Microsoft Knowledge Base article #239869 and follow instructions described there.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of the Samba suite.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The ntlm_auth manpage was written by Jelmer Vernooij and Andrew Bartlett.
