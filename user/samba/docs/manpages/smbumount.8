.SH "NAME"
smbumount - smbfs umount for normal users
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 10
\fBsmbumount\fR {mount-point}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
With this program, normal users can unmount smb-filesystems, provided that it is suid root.
\fBsmbumount\fR
has been written to give normal Linux users more control over their resources. It is safe to install this program suid root, because only the user who has mounted a filesystem is allowed to unmount it again. For root it is not necessary to use smbumount. The normal umount program works perfectly well.
