.SH "NAME"
vfstest - tool for testing samba VFS modules
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 8
\fBvfstest\fR [-d debuglevel] [-c command] [-l logdir] [-h]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite.
.PP
\fBvfstest\fR
is a small command line utility that has the ability to test dso samba VFS modules. It gives the user the ability to call the various VFS functions manually and supports cascaded VFS modules.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
-c|--command=command
.RS 3n
Execute the specified (colon-separated) commands. See below for the commands that are available.
.RE
.PP
-h|--help
.RS 3n
Print a summary of command line options.
.RE
.PP
-l|--logfile=logbasename
.RS 3n
File name for log/debug files. The extension
\fB'.client'\fR
will be appended. The log file is never removed by the client.
.RE
.PP
-V
.RS 3n
Prints the program version number.
.RE
.PP
-s <configuration file>
.RS 3n
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
\fIsmb.conf\fR
for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.
.RE
.PP
-d|--debuglevel=level
.RS 3n
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

parameter in the
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file.
.RE
.PP
-l|--logfile=logdirectory
.RS 3n
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
\fB".progname"\fR
will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.
