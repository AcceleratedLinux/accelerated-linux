.SH "EVENTLOG RECORD FORMAT"
.PP

expects to be able to read structured records from standard input. These records are a sequence of lines, with the record key and data separated by a colon character. Records are separated by at least one or more blank line.
.PP
The event log record field are:
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBLEN\fR
- This field should be 0, since
\fBeventlogadm\fR
will calculate this value.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBRS1\fR
- This must be the value 1699505740.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBRCN\fR
- This field should be 0.
.TP 3n

- The time the eventlog record was generated; format is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970, UTC.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBTMW\fR
- The time the eventlog record was written; format is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970, UTC.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBEID\fR
- The eventlog ID.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

&#8226;

\fBUSL\fR
- This field should be 0.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBSRC\fR
- This field contains the source name associated with the event log. If a message file is used with an event log, there will be a registry entry for associating this source name with a message file DLL.
.TP 3n
&#8226;

\fBSRN\fR

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
An example of the record format accepted by
\fBeventlogadm\fR:

.nf

	LEN: 0
	RS1: 1699505740
	RCN: 0
	TMG: 1128631322
	TMW: 1128631322
	EID: 1000

	    	%SystemRoot%/system32/MyApplication.dll
	
.fi
.PP
Filter messages from the system log into an event log:

.nf

	tail -f /var/log/messages | \\
		my_program_to_parse_into_eventlog_records | \\
	      	eventlogadm SystemLogEvents
