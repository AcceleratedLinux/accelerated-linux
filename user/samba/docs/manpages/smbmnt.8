.SH "NAME"
smbmnt - helper utility for mounting SMB filesystems
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 7
\fBsmbmnt\fR {mount-point} [-s <share>] [-r] [-u <uid>] [-g <gid>] [-f <mask>] [-d <mask>] [-o <options>] [-h]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsmbmnt\fR
is a helper application used by the smbmount program to do the actual mounting of SMB shares.
\fBsmbmnt\fR
can be installed setuid root if you want normal users to be able to mount their SMB shares.
.PP
A setuid smbmnt will only allow mounts on directories owned by the user, and that the user has write permission on.
.PP
The
\fBsmbmnt\fR
program is normally invoked by
\fBsmbmount\fR(8). It should not be invoked directly by users.

smbmount searches the normal PATH for smbmnt. You must ensure that the smbmnt version in your path matches the smbmount used.
