.SH "NAME"
pam_winbind - PAM module for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite.
.PP
pam_winbind is a PAM module that can authenticate users against the local domain by talking to the Winbind daemon.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
pam_winbind supports several options which can either be set in the PAM configuration files or in the pam_winbind configuration file situated at
\fI/etc/security/pam_winbind.conf\fR. Options from the PAM configuration file take precedence to those from the configuration file.
.PP
debug
.RS 3n
Gives debugging output to syslog.
.RE
.PP
require_membership_of=[SID or NAME]
.RS 3n
If this option is set, pam_winbind will only succeed if the user is a member of the given SID or NAME. A SID can be either a group-SID, a alias-SID or even a user-SID. It is also possible to give a NAME instead of the SID. That name must have the form:
\fIMYDOMAIN\\mygroup\fR
or
\fIMYDOMAIN\\myuser\fR. pam_winbind will, in that case, lookup the SID internally. Note that NAME may not contain any spaces. It is thus recommended to only use SIDs. You can verify the list of SIDs a user is a member of with
\fBwbinfo --user-sids=SID\fR.

try_first_pass
.RS 3n

.RE
.PP
use_first_pass
.RS 3n
By default, pam_winbind tries to get the authentication token from a previous module. If no token is available it asks the user for the old password. With this option, pam_winbind aborts with an error if no authentication token from a previous module is available.
.RE
.PP
use_authtok
.RS 3n
Set the new password to the one provided by the previously stacked password module. If this option is not set pam_winbind will ask the user for the new password.
.RE
.PP
krb5_auth
.RS 3n
pam_winbind can authenticate using Kerberos when winbindd is talking to an Active Directory domain controller. Kerberos authentication must be enabled with this parameter. When Kerberos authentication can not succeed (e.g. due to clock skew), winbindd will fallback to samlogon authentication over MSRPC. When this parameter is used in conjunction with
\fIwinbind refresh tickets\fR, winbind will keep your Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) uptodate by refreshing it whenever necessary.
.RE
.PP
krb5_ccache_type=[type]
.RS 3n
When pam_winbind is configured to try kerberos authentication by enabling the
\fIkrb5_auth\fR
option, it can store the retrieved Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) in a credential cache. The type of credential cache can be set with this option. Currently the only supported value is:
\fIFILE\fR. In that case a credential cache in the form of /tmp/krb5cc_UID will be created, where UID is replaced with the numeric user id. Leave empty to just do kerberos authentication without having a ticket cache after the logon has succeeded.
.RE
.PP
cached_login
.RS 3n
Winbind allows to logon using cached credentials when
\fIwinbind offline logon\fR
is enabled. To use this feature from the PAM module this option must be set.
.RE
.PP
silent
.RS 3n
Do not emit any messages.
