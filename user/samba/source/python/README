This directory contains Python bindings to allow you to access various
aspects of Samba.  At the moment their status is "experimental" and
they are not built by default.

In order to be able to compile samba-python you need to have python
and the python-dev packages installed.

Python libraries are always built for a particular version of Python
(2.2, 2.1, etc), and libraries built for one version will not be seen
by another.  By default Samba's libraries are built for whatever is
installed as "python" on your $PATH, but you can override this using
the --with-python option.  For example

  $ ./configure --with-python=python2.2

To build:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure 
$ make python_ext

Now, you can install the modules:

$ cp build/lib.*/*.so /usr/lib/python2.1/lib-dynload/

(the directory /usr/lib/python2.1 may vary, depending on your installation)

Samba-python should work now!
