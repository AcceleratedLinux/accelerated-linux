Copyright (C) 1997-2003 Samba-Team

The Samba-Team are committed to an aggressive program to deliver quality
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

The current Samba series of Samba 3.0.0 is called the "Domain Integration"
release.

The following development objectives for future releases
are in progress:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samba-3.0.20	The release that is focussing on scalability and domain
				integration and migration. See the WHATSNEW.txt file for
				update notes.

Samba-3.0.x		Improvements in Management and Migration tools, &
				general code stabilization work. It is recommended to use
				only stable releases in production environments. You have
				been duly warned!

Samba-3.1.x		The test bed for all new developments. Do NOT use in any
				production environment.

Samba-4			Danger Will Robinson, a big code clean up with major
			system redesign. More will be announced as this work
			starts to take shape.


Note that it is a given that the Samba-Team will continue to track
Windows (NT/200x) update releases, ensuring that Samba will work
well with whatever "Beta" releases Redmond throws our way :-).

You may also note that the release numbers get fuzzier the
further into the future the objectives get. This is intentional
as we cannot commit to exact timeframes.
