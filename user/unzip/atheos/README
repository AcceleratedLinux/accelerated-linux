UnZip 5.51 for AtheOS/Syllable

This port is based on both BeOS and UNIX versions.
As BeOS version it can extract specific file attributes.

TODO
----
There is only one thing to be fixed:
 write_attr() should return count of bytes written. However that's a bug
 related with AFS only.

Please report any bugs to Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu.
If this bug related with AtheOS/Syllable only, you can mail me directly:
 nruslan@hotbox.ru.
