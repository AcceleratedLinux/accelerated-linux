crc_i386.c has been tested with MSVC and can be selected through the MSVC
makefile.  It is provided for those who may have MSVC but no assembler.
Note that some C compilers on Pentium-class machines have been reported
to emit faster code from the plain C sources (crc32.c) than the assembler
routines provide.  This has not been tested lately, however.
