UnZip, version 5.51, 22 May 2004

Features added (or removed):

5.51a (09 Mar 02):
 - no new features

5.51b (11 Jan 03):
 - TANDEM: new -r option to suppress extension merging [Dave Smith]
 - WinCE, new port in addition to pUnZip (GUI): command line tool usable for
    "batch" processes (not quite finished, needs "makefile" cleanup, tests,
    and refinements) [Simon Roberts, SPC]
 - SET_DIR_ATTRIB feature code revised and reorganized to allow seamless
    adaption to different OS environments; added support for restoring
    directory timestamps to the WIN32 port [Kai-Uwe-Rommel, SPC]

5.51c (13 May 03):
 - WinCE command line tool integration is (almost) finished: project file is
    cleaned up and works with VC-embedded 3.0; port needs testing... [SPC]

5.51d (27 Feb 04):
 - Cygwin is recognized as a target in the Unix port
    [Charles Wilson, Cosmin Truta, SPC]
 - remove support for quoting characters from all ports; this feature was a
    security hole [SPC]

5.51e (01 Mar 04):
 - Win32 port (list.c, unzpriv.h, win32.c, w32cfg.h): the date in (non-ZipInfo)
    listings is displayed using the separator given by the system's locale,
    when available [Cosmin Truta]

5.51f (16 Apr 04):
 - no new features

5.51 final (22 May 04):
 - no new features

Bugs fixed:

5.51a (09 Mar 02):
 - process.c: corrected process_zipfiles() message and return code when a
    wildcard archive spec matches exactly one "non-ziparchive" file [SPC]
 - fileio.c: fixed partflush() "-a" textmode output for 16-bit ports
    (was a new bug, introduced in 5.50) [SPC]
 - inflate.c: modified CHECK_EOF code to allow "virtual" reading beyond EOF in
    NEEDBITS() macro to fix an old but rarely triggered extraction bug [SPC]
 - amiga/flate.a, human68k/flate.s: attempted to synchronize with changed
    C version [SPC]
 - explode.c, inflate.c, globals.h, unzpriv.h: cleaned up some "signed vs.
    unsigned" inconsistencies [SPC]
 - inflate.c: provided workaround for CHECK_EOF problem when using zlib (send
    a fake input byte when seeing error because of "premature" EOF) [SPC]
 - unzpriv.h: disabled DEFLATE64 when compiling/linking against zlib [SPC]
 - windll/windll_lc.def: added missing file to distribution archive [SPC]
 - windll/vb/vbunzip.bas: corrected UZDLLServ callback function - the second
    function parameter is the size of the archive entry, not the length of
    the message string [SPC]

5.51b (11 Jan 03):
 - consts.h, funzip.c, inflate.c, unzpriv.h: changed type of mask_bits[] array
    into "unsigned" for better core-loop performance [SPC]
 - amiga/flate.a, human68k/flate.s: small correction (optimization) to changes
    in 5.51a, removed debugging stuff [Paul Kienitz]
 - fileio.c: added display of system error string to error message shown when
    open_input_file() fails at the [f]open() function [SPC]
 - process.c: slightly generalize summary message when no Zip archive could be
    found or opened (file may be present but unaccessible due to locking or
    insufficient permission) [Santiago Vila, SPC]
 - globals.h: undefine zlib_version macro when compiling against zlib to work
    around a naming conflict [SPC]
 - unzpriv.h: do not define WILD_STAT_BUG for Borland C on WIN32 [SPC]
 - unzip.h, unzpriv.h: added precautions for some WIN32 compiler environments
    which also try to appear as UNIX compatible [SPC]
 - tandem/tanunz.c bugfix: set file code of generic (non-Tandem) non-text files
    to 0 (unstructured) instead of 100 (object file) [Dave Smith]
 - win32/win32.c: added recognition for Borland C++ Builder 6.0 to version()
    [Brad Clarke]
 - tandem/tanunz.c bugfix: set file code of Enscribe files containing text data
    to 101 (Edit) [Dave Smith]
 - api.c writeToMemory(), fileio.c flush(): Added check for buffer overflow
    when extracting to memory and output buffer is different from decompression
    work area [Samuel R. Blackburn, SPC]
 - tandem configuration bugfix: Deflate64 was incompatible with non-WIDE memory
    models; fixed OUTBUFSIZ logic and "unsigned" vs. "size_t" incompatibility
    issues [Dave Smith, SPC]

5.51c (13 May 03):
 - OS2, WIN32, WinCE: '\\' chars are not allowed in file names, map them to '_'
    to prevent misinterpreting them as directory separators [David F, SPC]
 - windll, VB example: updated integration of "Open file" common dialog and
    added special Readme text to document installation and maintenance issues
    of the VB example code [ED, SPC]
 - unzpriv.h: enclosed shift op expressions in definitions of MPN_xxx macro
    constant with parentheses (for safety) [Cosmin Truta]
 - win32/win32.c: fixed bugs in set_direc_attribs(), do not try to set dirtimes
    on Win9x systems [Cosmin Truta]
 - SET_DIR_ATTRIBS option: changed defer_dir_attribs() function interface to
    allow non-error return without deferred direntry data [SPC]
 - BeOS, Theos: updated SET_DIR_ATTRIBS code to work with the revised generic
    code [SPC]
 - WinCE port: revitalized WinCE port code, updated VC project files, added
    "VC embedded Tools 3.0" project file [SPC]
 - unzip.h: added rule to define UNIX flag for NetBSD [Ray Phillips]
 - unix/Makefile: added "-DUNIX" to default CF settings, to get rid of misc
    problems concerning auto-detection of a "Unix" environment [SPC]
 - LICENSE: include SFXWiz in the exeption clause concerning distribution
    of self-extracting archives [Greg Roelofs]
 - Amiga, AosVS, Atari, BeOS, FlexOS, Human68K, MacOS, MSDOS, Novell, OS/2,
    Unix, Win32, (Theos, WinCE - only code sync, no bug to fix):
    fixed hole in directory traversal security code which did not recognize
    "../" when path component contained some control character which was
    silently skipped ["jelmer", SPC]

 - all SYMLINKS-capable ports (AOS/VS, Atari, BeOS, Unix): defer creation of
    symlinks until all extractions for current archive are finished, to close
    a security hole (bug report by Jan Echternach)
