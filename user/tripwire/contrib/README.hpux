Well, I tried again with gcc-2.5.8.u5 (Utah port of gcc) and still get the
following:

    gcc -O           -c dbase.update.c
    In file included from ../include/config.h:20,
		     from dbase.update.c:15:
    ../include/../configs/conf-hpux.h:15: warning: `_HPUX_SOURCE' redefined
    *Initialization*:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
    lex config.pre.l
    lex: warning: Cannot read message catalog; using default language
    mv lex.yy.c config.lex.c
    yacc config.pre.y
    sed 's/lex\.yy\.c/config.lex.c/' < y.tab.c > config.pre.c 
    rm y.tab.c
    gcc -O           -c config.pre.c
    In file included from ../include/config.h:20,
		     from config.pre.y:40:
    ../include/../configs/conf-hpux.h:15: warning: `_HPUX_SOURCE' redefined
    *Initialization*:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
    config.lex.c: In function `__yy__unused':
    In file included from config.pre.y:385:
    config.lex.c:219: too few arguments to function `main'
    make[1]: *** [config.pre.o] Error 1
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/wk0/net/src/tripwire-1.1/src'
    make: *** [all] Error 1

As a reminder here are the status updates from a previous message (all are
with HP cc).

   Compiled without -O
   === test.update.sh: BEGIN ===
   ../src/tripwire -loosedir -c /tmp/twtest/tw.config -d /tmp/twtest/tw.db -i all
   ../src/tripwire: /tmp/twt: disappeared.  Skipping...

   Compiled with -O
   === test.update.sh: BEGIN ===
   ../src/tripwire -loosedir -c /tmp/twtest/tw.config -d /tmp/twtest/tw.db -i all
   ../src/tripwire: : disappeared.  Skipping...

   Compiled without -O and with -g
   === test.update.sh: BEGIN ===
   ../src/tripwire -loosedir -c /tmp/twtest/tw.config -d /tmp/twtest/tw.db -i all
   === test.update.sh: testing GROWING (safe) files ===
   === test.update.sh: testing GROWING (unsafe) files ===

In summary, I have tried cc with and without -O (did not work); gcc with and
without -ansi (versions 2.4.5 and 2.5.8), with flex and bison, lex and yacc
(none worked). The only thing that did work was HP cc with lex and yacc,
without -O and with -g.

I don't know what it all means but I thought you might like to know.
