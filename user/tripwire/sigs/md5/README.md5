    The MD5 message-digesting package is copyrighted by RSA Data
Security, Inc.  The disclaimer from the C code has been retained,
and is shown above.

    All big-endian/little-endian specific code in md5.c has been
replaced by code that can resolve this automatically at
compile-time.  Tripwire specific code is in md5wrapper.c, which
contains the routine 'sig_md5_get' to minimize the amount of
overhead in collecting signatures from within Tripwire.  (We
certainly don't want to fork() for every file we need to scan!)

    Because of this, these files is no longer identical to the
MD5 virgin distribution.  I have sent my changes to the MD5
author, but I am not aware of any buybacks at this time.

    The original MD5 code can be found in the Internet Working 
Draft RFC 1321.  This can be obtained via anonymous FTP (user =
anonymous, password = guest) from NIC.DDN.MIL.
