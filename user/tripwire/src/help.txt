		with the file.  (i.e., read, write, and execute 
		permission bits).
st_ino:		the inode number, which uniquely labels the file within
		the filesystem.  
st_nlink:	the number of links to a file which exist.  (Adding a 
		hard-link to a file or creates a subdirectory adds one
		to this number.)
st_uid:		the user-id of the file owner.
st_gid:		the group-id of the file owner.
st_size:	the size (in bytes) of the file.
st_atime:	the timestamp of the last file access.
st_mtime:	the timestamp of the last file modification.
st_ctime:	the timestamp of the last inode update.
sig[0..9]:	the 'fingerprint' yeilded by each signature routine.
