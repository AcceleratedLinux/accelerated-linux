    The file "designdoc.ps" is a paper describing the design and
implementation of Tripwire.  Unlike the original version shipped with
early beta Tripwire distributions that were formatted with troff and
the ms macros, this document was written in Latex.  Because of this,
only the Postscript output is shipped.

    If you have problems printing this Postscript document, you can
order this paper as a technical report from Purdue.  This document is
titled "The Design and Implementation of Tripwire: A UNIX File
Integrity Checker" by Gene H. Kim and Eugene H. Spafford, Purdue
Technical Report CSD-TR-93-071.  For more details, mail
(spaf@cs.purdue.edu).

    We're very interested in feedback.  Please send any comments,
questions, and other verbalizations to (gkim@cs.purdue.edu) and
(spaf@cs.purdue.edu).
