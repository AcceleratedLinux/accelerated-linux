The patch files found in this directory fix two problems that diald
reveals in other programs.

ppp-2.1.2d.patch	- Fix pppd version 2.1.2d so that it makes correct
			  use of of /dev/cua* devices when the device is
			  passed in as the standard input and output.
			  Without this patch pppd-2.1.2d and diald will not
			  work together on /dev/cua* devices when either
			  the setserial option "session_lockout" or
			  "pgrp_lockout" is in force. If you can't turn off
			  these setserial options (avoiding messing up some
			  versions of getty) then you'll need this patch.

ppp-2.2.0e.patch	- Fix pppd version 2.2.0e the same way the
			  above patch fixes ppp-2.1.2d.

ppp-2.2.0f.patch	- Fix pppd version 2.2.0f the same way the
			  above patch fixes ppp-2.2.0e.

tcsh.patch		- Fix tcsh so that it ignores utmp entries for
			  machines named " ". These get left around by
			  some versions of xterm, and there presence
			  can cause tcsh to make a name service query, which
			  in turn can cause diald to bring up the link.
