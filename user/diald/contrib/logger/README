The code in this directory is by Brian Edmonds <edmonds@cs.ubc.ca>.

Here is the initial mail message Brian sent to the linux-diald mailing
list about these scripts. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've written a bunch of perl scripts which I use to monitor my SLIP
usage with the diald account log.  They include both daily and weekly
usage summaries, plus montly usage overviews with graphs of traffic
in/out and time spent online.  Would people be interested in having them
posted to the list?

I've also made one change to the way diald operates in order to support
them.  Each time it writes to the accounting log, I have it open the
file, and close it immediately after.  This allows me to rotate the log
files in the scripts so that they don't grow without bound.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scripts you find here are the scripts he refers to.
This stuff is as is. You'll have to wade through it your self to get
things to work. Each has been extracted from a mail message that gave
a short bit of explanitory text. Just so people aren't too lost, here
is the explanitory text Brian include with each of these files.
If you really like this stuff you might want to ask Brian to turn
it into a plug&play package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
logreporter:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I originally wrote the enclosed Perl (4.036) script to summarize syslog
files, but it is sufficiently general that it works passably for diald
accounting logs.  If you want to use it to do daily reporting on the
contents of your syslog file, please feel free.  I log things fairly
extensively, and as such have thousands of lines per day which my
syslog.template routines reduces to one screen of mail each morning.

The template file format may not be easily discernable from the script
or even the comments I just added, but should be clarified by the
templates that I'll be posting shortly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
runlogger:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, here's the simplest script.  I run this one daily from cron at
midnight, and all it does is run logreporter over the accounting log
from the last 24 hours, then append the data to the weekly logfile and
truncate the accounting logfile.  Make sure that cron is mailing its
output to you, and you'll get the daily summary in your mailbox.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
diald.weekly:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the next more difficult script.  I run this one weekly from cron
to summarize the week's total traffic.  Run it without arguments to
simply mail the results to yourself.  I run it with -p to post to my
local statistics newsgroup (you'll likely have to change the name).  It
also rotates the weekly logfile unless the -n option is given.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
diald.monthly:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the last, and most complex (or is that rambling?) script.  It
summarizes the weekly logs for the last month in the form of a number of
wonderful (and probably useless) ASCII bar charts.  It picks whatever
month it was 24 hours ago as the month to summarize for, so you should
run it on the first day of each month to do the month before.  Again, no
arguments to just mail it, and -p to post it.  You'll likely have to
change where it finds the weekly log files, and if you're post, what
group it posts to, and what injector it uses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
diald.template:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is /var/log/diald.template on my system, and accompanies where I
have the diald accounting log, /var/log/diald.log.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
syslog.template:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a considerably more complex logreporter template.  It should
exercise all the capabilities of the script, however.  You'll have to do
a bit of customization in places to tweak this for your own system.
