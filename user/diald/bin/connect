# This script is intended to give an example of a connection script that
# uses the "message" facility of diald to communicate progress through
# the dialing process to a diald monitoring program such as dctrl or diald-top.
# It also reports progress to the system logs. This can be useful if you
# are seeing failed attempts to connect and you want to know when and why
# they are failing.
#
# This script requires the use of chat-1.9 or greater for full
# functionality. It should work with older versions of chat,
# but it will not be able to report the reason for a connection failure.

# Configuration parameters

# The initialization string for your modem

MODEM_INIT="ATZ&C1&D2%C0"

# The phone number to dial
PHONE_NUMBER="5551212"

# The chat sequence to recognize that the remote system
# is asking for your user name.
USER_CHAT_SEQ="name:--name:--name:--name:--name:--name:--name:"

# The string to send in response to the request for your user name.
USER_NAME="USER"

# The chat sequence to recongnize that the remote system
# is asking for your password.
PASSWD_CHAT_SEQ="word:"

# The string to send in response to the request for your password.
PASSWORD="PASSWORD"

# The prompt the remote system will give once you are logged in
# If you do not define this then the script will assume that
# there is no command to be issued to start up the remote protocol.
PROMPT="annex:"
# The command to issue to start up the remote protocol
PROTOCOL_START="ppp"

# The string to wait for to see that the protocol on the remote
# end started OK. If this is empty then no check will be performed.
START_ACK="Switching to PPP."

# Pass a message on to diald and the system logs.
