 Notes on Mike Reid's Cube Program
 ---------------------------------

 I have re-compiled Mike Reid's cube program for MS-DOS.

 It needs cwsdpmi.exe to run.

 It runs much better in straight DOS with little else in memory. I'm
 currently using a Pentium 100 with 32 megs of RAM.

 You must pass the cube's position as stdin as so:

 UF UR UB UL DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL UFR URB UBL ULF DRF DFL DLB DBR

 That is, you must pass a cube position in standard Singmaster notation
 as a set of edges and corners.

 For example, cube in a cube would be:

 UF UR RD RB LU LF DB DL FR UB DF BL UFR RFD RDB RBU LFU LUB DLB LDF

 And the program would eventually output:

 U L2 D R B' R B' R B' D' L2 U R2 F2 U2   (15f, 20q)


 IMPORTANT NOTE: Remember the program is generating the solution to the
                 position you pass to the program. To generate the
                 given position from a solved cube you must use the
                 inverse of the program's output.

I also modified my own cube program (rubik_is.exe) to fed Mike Reid's
program. Now you can save the current position by hitting '/' or
forward slash. It will save a text file (e.g. pons.txt) so then
the user would run Mike's program as follows:

     miker < pons.txt

Both my program and Mike's program is available from
