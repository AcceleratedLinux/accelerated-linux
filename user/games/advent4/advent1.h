	"you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a\n"
	"nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of\n"
	"oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their\n"
	"ends, and a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side\n"
	"a great many Dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring\n"
	"loudly.  A sign nearby reads:\n"
	"        \"Do NOT disturb the Dwarves!\"\n"

	"You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one\n"
	"side is a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the other\n"
	"side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains\n"

// 125
	"The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard\n"

	"You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an \n"
	"active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging \n"

	"everything an eerie, macabre appearance.\n"
	"The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of \n"
	"brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the \n"
	"volcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far \n"
	"overhead are myriad formations composed of pure white alabaster, which \n"
	"scatter their murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.\n"
	"To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured \n"
	"rock which seems to have been crafted by the Devil Himself.  An \n"
	"immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, \n"
	"burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit \n"
	"far off to your left.  \n"
	"To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts \n"
	"continuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, \n"
	"which bubbles ominously. The far right wall is aflame with an \n"
