	"I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary \n"

	"like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up \n"
	"or down.  \n"
	"I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the \n"
	"cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words \n"
	"I know. Usually you will need to give both the object and action words \n"
	"(In either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb \n"
	"alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, \"inventory\" \n"
	"implies \"take inventory\", which causes me to give you a list of what \n"
	"you're carrying.\n"
	"The objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird. \n"
	"Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more \n"
	"words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object \n"
	"are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should \n"
	"try a completely different tack.\n"
	"To speed the game up, you can sometimes move long distances with a \n"
	"single word.  For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the building \n"
	"from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note \n"
	"that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north \n"
	"does not guarantee entering the next from the south. Good luck!\n",

	"The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple,\n"

	"a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus\n"
	"nondescript bushes of various sorts.  This time of year \n"

// 130
	"A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:\n"
	"\"This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office.\"\n",

	"It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so\n"
	"close to closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.\n",
// 132
	"The sepulchral voice entones, \"The cave is now closed.\"  As\n"
	"the echoes fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a\n"
	"small puff of orange smoke). . . . \n"
	"As your eyes refocus you look around and find...\n",
// 133
	"There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in\n"
	"the far wall, burying the Dwarves in the rubble.  You march\n"
	"through the hole and find yourself in the main office, where\n"
	"a cheering band of friendly elves carry the conquering\n"
	"adventurer off into the sunset.\n",
// 134
	"There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in\n"
	"the far wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of\n"
	"molten lava pours in through the hole, destroying\n"
	"everything in its path, including you!!\n",
// 135
	"There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across\n"
	"the walls of the room.\n",
// 136
	"The resulting ruckus has awakened the Dwarves.  There are now\n"
	"several threatening little Dwarves in the room with you!\n"
	"Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!\n",
// 137
	"Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.\n",
// 138
	"I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.\n",
// 139
	"I don't know the word \"stop\".   Use \"quit\" if you want to\n"
	"give up.\n",
// 140
	"You can't get there from here.\n",
// 141
	"You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.\n",
// 142
	"If you want to end your adventure early, say \"quit\".  To suspend your \n"
	"adventure such that you can continue later say \"suspend\" (or \"pause\" \n"
	"or \"save\").  To load a previously saved game, say 'load' or 'restore'.  \n"
	"To see how well you're doing, say \"score\".  To get full credit for a \n"
	"treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get \n"
	"partial credit just for locating it. You lose points for getting \n"
	"killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more. \n"
	"There are also points based on how much (If any) of the cave you've \n"
	"managed to explore;  in particular, there is a large bonus just for \n"
	"getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), \n"
	"and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some \n"
	"of the more harrowing sections. \n"
	"If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a \n"
	"while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found them all \n"
	"yet.  If something interesting DOES happen, it means you're getting a \n"
	"bonus and have an opportunity to garner many more points in the \n"
	"master's section.\n"
	"I may occasionally offer hints in you seem to be having trouble.  If I \n"
	"do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will affect your score to \n"
	"accept the hints.  Finally, to save paper, you may specify \"brief\", \n"
	"which tells me never to repeat the full description of a place unless \n"
	"you explicitly ask me to.\n",
// 143
	"Do you indeed wish to quit now?\n",
// 144
	"There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.\n",
// 145
	"The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered\n"
	"the vase.\n",
// 146
	"It is beyond your power to do that.\n",
// 147
	"I don't know how.\n",
// 148
	"It is too far up for you to reach.\n",
// 149
	"You killed a little Dwarf.  The body vanished in a cloud\n"
	"of greasy black smoke.\n",
// 150
	"The shell is very strong and impervious to attack.\n",
// 151
	"What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start\n"
	"over.\n",
// 152
	"The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.\n",
// 153
	"The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.\n",
// 154
	"The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an\n"
	"astounding flurry gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.\n",
// 155
	"On what?\n",
// 156
	"Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the\n"
	"first time you come to it.  To get the full description\n"
	"say \"look\".\n",
// 157
	"Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as\n"
	"tough as that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your\n"
	"blows effortlessly.\n",
// 158
	"The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully,\n"
	"and tosses it back, declaring, \"Good workmanship,\n"
	"but it's not valuable enough.\".\n",
// 159
	"The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.\n",
// 160
	"The troll refuses to let you cross.\n",
// 161
	"There is no longer any way across the chasm.\n",
// 162
	"Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath\n"
	"the weight of the bear, which was still following you around.\n"
	"You scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge \n"
	"collapses you stumble back and fall into the chasm.\n",
// 163
	"The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a\n"
	"startled shriek and scurries away.  The bear soon gives\n"
	"up pursuit and wanders back.\n",
// 164
	"The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get\n"
	"at it.\n",
// 165
	"With what?  Your bare hands?  Agains HIS bear hands??\n",
// 166
	"The bear is confused;  he only wants to be your friend.\n",
// 167
	"For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!\n",
// 168
	"The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems\n"
	"to calm down considerably, and even becomes rather friendly.\n",
// 169
	"The bear is still chained to the wall.\n",
// 170
	"The chain is still locked.\n",
// 171
	"The chain is now unlocked.\n",
// 172
	"The chain is now locked.\n",
// 173
	"There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.\n",
// 174
	"There is nothing here to eat.\n",

	"Do you want the hint?\n",
// 176
	"Do you need help getting out of the maze?\n",
// 177
	"You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.\n",
// 178
	"Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?\n",
// 179

	"worry about falling into a pit.  None of the objects\n"
	"available is immediately useful in descovering the secret.\n",

	"there's a vending machine in the maze.  Bring some coins\n"
	"with you.\n",
// 184
	"Your lamp has run out of power.\n",
// 185
	"There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you\n"
	"can't explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call\n"
	"it a day.\n",
// 186
	"There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.\n"
	"As you turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a\n"
	"bearded pirate.  He is carrying a large chest.  \"Shiver me\n"
	"timbers!\"  he cries, \"I've been spotted!  I'd best hide\n"
	"meself off to the maze and hide me chest!\".  With that,\n"
	"he vanished into the gloom.\n",

	"Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for\n"
	"those batteries.\n",

	"Your lamp is getting dim.. I'm taking the liberty of replacing\n"
	"the batteries.\n",

	"You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the\n"
	"ground.\n",

	"You prod the nearest Dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes\n"

	"There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.\n"
