/* This include file defines the interface between the main part
   of the debugger, and the part which is target-specific, or
   specific to the communications interface between us and the
   target.

   A TARGET is an interface between the debugger and a particular 
   kind of file or process.  Targets can be STACKED in STRATA, 
   so that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.
   In particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
   until they find a target that is interested in handling that particular
   address.  STRATA are artificial boundaries on the stack, within
   which particular kinds of targets live.  Strata exist so that
   people don't get confused by pushing e.g. a process target and then
   a file target, and wondering why they can't see the current values
   of variables any more (the file target is handling them and they
   never get to the process target).  So when you push a file target,
   it goes into the file stratum, which is always below the process
   stratum.  */

/* This is based strongly on Unix/POSIX signals for several reasons:
   (1) This set of signals represents a widely-accepted attempt to
   represent events of this sort in a portable fashion, (2) we want a
   signal to make it from wait to child_wait to the user intact, (3) many
   remote protocols use a similar encoding.  However, it is
   recognized that this set of signals has limitations (such as not
   distinguishing between various kinds of SIGSEGV, or not
   distinguishing hitting a breakpoint from finishing a single step).
   So in the future we may get around this either by adding additional
   signals for breakpoint, single-step, etc., or by adding signal
   codes; the latter seems more in the spirit of what BSD, System V,
   etc. are doing to address these issues.  */
