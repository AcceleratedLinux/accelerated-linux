Tips for using lrpStat:

Windows users: Running the application without the Java console-window

    To my great embarrasment, Guido Muesch pointed out to me that this 
    "tip" was totally unnecessary - since the jdk includes the jawaw.exe 
    executable, which does exactly that.
    So, the short version of this tip is, use javaw.exe instead of 
    java.exe. My Windows installation also includes wjview.exe, which 
    seems to be working just fine as well.
    So there's really no need to be "hacking" your java.exe, but I'll 
    leave this tip as an example how it could be done (and also, so it 
    doesn't seem like I'm trying to cover my tracks...)

    <OBSOLETE>
      Getting this to work requires that you have Microsoft Visual Studio 
      (or rather the editbin-executable that comes with Visual-Studio).
      To generate a special java.exe that doesn't show a console, open a 
      command prompt, go to the directory java.exe resides in and do the 
      following:

      copy java.exe java_gui.exe
      editbin /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS java_gui.exe

      That's all, you now have a special version of your java.exe 
      (java_gui.exe) that will not open a console-window. Of course, that also
      means you won't see any error-messages...

All users: Using the application to monitor several servers at once

    Even though this is in the documentation, I wanted to point this out again.
    It is possible (but only using the application, not by using the applet) to
    monitor several different servers with one instance of the program.

    To do this, all you need to do is to specify several [-configfile
    htmlFilename] -hostname routername [paramName paramValue] [paramName
    paramValue] blocks. For example, if you want to monitor router1 and
    router2, and you have separate html-files for those, the syntax would be:

    java LrpStatApplication 
            -hostname router1 
            -configfile router1.html 
            -hostname router2 
            -configfile router2.html


All users of non-LRP machines: Extended script for the server

	This script was sent to my by Andrew Hoying. It will not work with LEAF or LRP machines (at least not without
	adding awk and maybe also bash).
	This is provided "as is", I can't provide any support whatsoever (since I can't test this on my lrp box and also because I
	know so little shell scripting).

	#!/bin/sh -e
	trap "exit 1" 1
	trap "exit 1" 2

	cpu1=`awk '/cpu / {printf "%i %i",$2+$3+$4,$2+$3+$4+$5}' /proc/stat`
	ctxt1=`awk '/ctxt/ {print $2}' /proc/stat`
	ctxt=0
	cpu=0
	connects=0
	uniq=0
	sleep 1

	while [ 1 ]
	do
	  cpu2=`awk '/cpu / {printf "%i %i",$2+$3+$4,$2+$3+$4+$5}' /proc/stat`
	  ctxt2=`awk '/ctxt/ {print $2}' /proc/stat`
	  cputest=`echo $cpu1' '$cpu2|awk '{printf "%i", (($3-$1)/($4-$2))*100}'`
	  cpu=$(($cpu+$cputest))
	  cpu1=$cpu2
	  ctxttest=$((($ctxt2-$ctxt1)/10))
	  ctxt=$(($ctxt+$ctxttest))
	  ctxt1=$ctxt2
	  connects=$(($connects + `cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack|wc -l`))
	  uniq=$(($uniq + `cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack |cut -d= -f 2|cut -d' ' -f 1|sort -u|wc -l`))
	  cat /proc/net/dev
	  echo cpu0:$cpu $cputest 0 0 0 0 0 0 $ctxt $ctxttest 0 0 0 0 0 0
	  echo conn0:$connects 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 $uniq 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
	  echo
	  echo "#"
	  sleep 1
	done
