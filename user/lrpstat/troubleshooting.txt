Troubleshooting

In case the applet doesn't work as expected, feel free to ask me for help
(send your mail to linux@hejl.de).

Common sources of problems with the applet/application are:

   * Using a 2.0.xx kernel (sorry, I haven't found a way to get the
     information needed for the applet on one of those kernels)
   * The firewall rules blocking access to the ports (either the
     web-server, or the stat-port (1024 by default))
   * /etc/hosts.allow being configured in a way that the connection to the
     stat-port is not allowed (default on Eigerstein images)
   * A typo/misconfiguration between /etc/services, /etc/inetd.conf and the
     html-file. This happened a lot during the first releases (mainly due
     to some major screw ups in the documentation). Make sure all service
     names are correct and refer to the correct port.

To give me a chance in finding the source of the problem, you should send
the following information along with your mail:

   * the relevant lines of /etc/services. For example:

     online          60180/tcp                       # goOnline
     offline         60181/tcp                       # goOffline
     stat            1024/tcp                       # general stats

   * the relevant lines of /etc/inetd.conf. For example:

     online   stream  tcp  nowait  root   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /sbin/net ifup ippp0
     offline  stream  tcp  nowait  root   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /sbin/net ifdown ippp0
     stat     stream  tcp  nowait  nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd  /sbin/lrpStat

   * the Netmon.html file (or rather, the html-file you use to load the
     applet)
   * a few seconds worth of the output of the stat.sh script or the lrpStat
     executable. Or even better, the output to telneting to the port
     defined in /etc/services (1024 if you used my default values). For
     example:

   * the output of the java console (remember, it's not enabled by default
     in Internet Explorer). For example:

     Setting Autoscale for DEV_0
     Setting Autoscale for DEV_1
     trying to open ghlx01:1024
     Socket opened ghlx01:1024

With that information, I should be able to figure out if it's a
misconfiguration or a bug in the applet (and hopefully solve the problem,
no matter what the reason was).
