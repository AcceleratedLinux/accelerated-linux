Thanks to everybody who have downloaded and tested JamVM.

In particular, I'd like to thank Mark Wielaard who has
extensively tested JamVM against Mauve and other applications,
and has provided numerous bug reports, Michael Koch, who
packages JamVM for Debian, and Robert Schuster who does the
same for Gentoo.
