This directory contains JamVM's Jar launcher wrapper
(jamvm.java.lang.JarLauncher) and the JamVM versions
of the VM-specific classes required to work with GNU
Classpath.  Most of these are derived from the
reference classes from GNU Classpath.

The classes are distributed pre-built in classes.zip
in order to simplify installation.  The classes.zip
archive will be automatically rebuilt if any Java
sources are changed.  Note, `jikes' must be present
within your path, and Classpath must have already been
built and installed as it requires glibj.zip.
