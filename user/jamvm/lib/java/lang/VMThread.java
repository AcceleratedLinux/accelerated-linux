/**
 * VM interface for Thread of executable code. Holds VM dependent state.
 * It is deliberately package local and final and should only be accessed
 * by the Thread class.
 * <p>
 * This is the GNU Classpath reference implementation, it should be adapted
 * for a specific VM.
 * <p>
 * The following methods must be implemented:
 * <ul>
 * <li>native void start(long stacksize);
 * <li>native void interrupt();
 * <li>native boolean isInterrupted();
 * <li>native void suspend();
 * <li>native void resume();
 * <li>native void nativeSetPriority(int priority);
 * <li>native void nativeStop(Throwable t);
 * <li>native static Thread currentThread();
 * <li>static native void yield();
 * <li>static native void sleep(long ms, int ns) throws InterruptedException;
 * <li>static native boolean interrupted();
 * <li>static native boolean holdsLock(Object obj);
 * </ul>
 * All other methods may be implemented to make Thread handling more efficient
 * or to implement some optional (and sometimes deprecated) behaviour. Default
 * implementations are provided but it is highly recommended to optimize them
 * for a specific VM.
