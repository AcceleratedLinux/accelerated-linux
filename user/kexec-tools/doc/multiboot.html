<H2><A NAME="motivation">Motivation</A></H2>

Every OS ever created tends to have its own boot loader.  Installing a new
OS on a machine generally involves installing a whole new set of boot
mechanisms, each with completely different install-time and boot-time user
interfaces.   Getting multiple operating systems to coexist reliably on one
machine through typical "chaining" mechanisms can be a nightmare.  There is
little or no choice of boot loaders for a particular operating system - if
the one that comes with the OS doesn't do exactly what you want, or doesn't
work on your machine, you're screwed.<P>

While we may not be able to fix this problem in existing commercial
operating systems, it shouldn't be too difficult for a few people in the
free OS communities to put their heads together and solve this problem for
the popular free operating systems.  That's what this standard aims for.
Basically, it specifies an interface between a boot loader and a operating
system, such that any complying boot loader should be able to load any
complying operating system.  This standard does NOT specify how boot
loaders should work - only how they must interface with the OS being
loaded.<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></H2>

Throughout this document, the term "boot loader" means whatever program or
set of programs loads the image of the final operating system to be run on
the machine.  The boot loader may itself consist of several stages, but
that is an implementation detail not relevant to this standard.  Only the
"final" stage of the boot loader - the stage that eventually transfers
control to the OS - needs to follow the rules specified in this document
in order to be "MultiBoot compliant"; earlier boot loader stages can be
designed in whatever way is most convenient.<P>

The term "OS image" is used to refer to the initial binary image that the
boot loader loads into memory and transfers control to to start the OS.
The OS image is typically an executable containing the OS kernel.<P>

The term "boot module" refers to other auxiliary files that the boot loader
loads into memory along with the OS image, but does not interpret in any
way other than passing their locations to the OS when it is invoked.<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="scope">Scope and Requirements</A></H2>

<H3>Architectures</H3>

This standard is primarily targetted at PC's, since they are the most
common and have the largest variety of OS's and boot loaders.  However, to
the extent that certain other architectures may need a boot standard and do
not have one already, a variation of this standard, stripped of the
x86-specific details, could be adopted for them as well.<P>

<H3>Operating systems</H3>

This standard is targetted toward free 32-bit operating systems that can be
fairly easily modified to support the standard without going through lots of
bureaucratic rigmarole.  The particular free OS's that this standard is
being primarily designed for are Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mach, and VSTa.
It is hoped that other emerging free OS's will adopt it from the start, and
thus immediately be able to take advantage of existing boot loaders.  It
would be nice if commercial operating system vendors eventually adopted
this standard as well, but that's probably a pipe dream.<P>

<H3>Boot sources</H3>

It should be possible to write compliant boot loaders that
load the OS image from a variety of sources, including floppy disk, hard
disk, and across a network.<P>

Disk-based boot loaders may use a variety of techniques to find the
relevant OS image and boot module data on disk, such as by interpretation
of specific file systems (e.g. the BSD/Mach boot loader), using
precalculated "block lists" (e.g. LILO), loading from a special "boot
partition" (e.g. OS/2), or even loading from within another operating
system (e.g. the VSTa boot code, which loads from DOS).  Similarly,
network-based boot loaders could use a variety of network hardware and
protocols.<P>

It is hoped that boot loaders will be created that support multiple loading
mechanisms, increasing their portability, robustness, and
user-friendliness.<P>

<H3>Boot-time configuration</H3>

It is often necessary for one reason or another for the user to be able to
provide some configuration information to the OS dynamically at boot time.
While this standard should not dictate how this configuration information
is obtained by the boot loader, it should provide a standard means for the
boot loader to pass such information to the OS.<P>

<H3>Convenience to the OS</H3>

OS images should be easy to generate.  Ideally, an OS image should simply
be an ordinary 32-bit executable file in whatever file format the OS
normally uses.  It should be possible to 'nm' or disassemble OS images just
like normal executables.  Specialized tools should not be needed to create
OS images in a "special" file format.  If this means shifting some work
from the OS to the boot loader, that is probably appropriate, because all
the memory consumed by the boot loader will typically be made available
again after the boot process is created, whereas every bit of code in the
OS image typically has to remain in memory forever.  The OS should not have
to worry about getting into 32-bit mode initially, because mode switching
code generally needs to be in the boot loader anyway in order to load OS
data above the 1MB boundary, and forcing the OS to do this makes creation
of OS images much more difficult.<P>

Unfortunately, there is a horrendous variety of executable file formats
even among free Unix-like PC-based OS's - generally a different format for
each OS.  Most of the relevant free OS's use some variant of a.out format,
but some are moving to ELF.  It is highly desirable for boot loaders not to
have to be able to interpret all the different types of executable file
formats in existence in order to load the OS image - otherwise the boot
loader effectively becomes OS-specific again.<P>

This standard adopts a compromise solution to this problem.
MultiBoot compliant boot images always either (a) are in ELF format, or (b)
contain a "magic MultiBoot header", described below, which allows the boot
loader to load the image without having to understand numerous a.out
variants or other executable formats.  This magic header does not need
to be at the very beginning of the executable file, so kernel images can
still conform to the local a.out format variant in addition to being
MultiBoot compliant.<P>

<H3>Boot modules</H3>

Many modern operating system kernels, such as those of VSTa and Mach, do
not by themselves contain enough mechanism to get the system fully
operational: they require the presence of additional software modules at
boot time in order to access devices, mount file systems, etc.  While these
additional modules could be embedded in the main OS image along with the
kernel itself, and the resulting image be split apart manually by the OS
when it receives control, it is often more flexible, more space-efficient,
and more convenient to the OS and user if the boot loader can load these
additional modules independently in the first place.<P>

Thus, this standard should provide a standard method for a boot loader to
indicate to the OS what auxiliary boot modules were loaded, and where they
can be found.  Boot loaders don't have to support multiple boot modules,
but they are strongly encouraged to, because some OS's will be unable to
boot without them.<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="details">Details</H2>

There are three main aspects of the boot-loader/OS image interface this
standard must specify:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The format of the OS image as seen by the boot loader.
<LI>The state of the machine when the boot loader starts the OS.
<LI>The format of the information passed by the boot loader to the OS.
</UL>

<H3>OS Image Format</H3>

An OS image is generally just an ordinary 32-bit executable file in the
standard format for that particular OS, except that it may be linked at a
non-default load address to avoid loading on top of the PC's I/O region
or other reserved areas, and of course it can't use shared libraries or
other fancy features.  Initially, only images in a.out format are
supported; ELF support will probably later be specified in the standard.<P>

Unfortunately, the exact meaning of the text, data, bss, and entry fields
of a.out headers tends to vary widely between different executable flavors,
and it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish one flavor from another
(e.g. Linux ZMAGIC executables and Mach ZMAGIC executables).  Furthermore,
there is no simple, reliable way of determining at what address in memory
the text segment is supposed to start.  Therefore, this standard requires
that an additional header, known as a 'multiboot_header', appear somewhere
near the beginning of the executable file.  In general it should come "as
early as possible", and is typically embedded in the beginning of the text
segment after the "real" executable header.  It _must_ be contained
completely within the first 8192 bytes of the executable file, and must be
longword (32-bit) aligned.  These rules allow the boot loader to find and
synchronize with the text segment in the a.out file without knowing
beforehand the details of the a.out variant.  The layout of the header is
as follows:<P>

<pre>
	+-------------------+
0	| magic: 0x1BADB002 |	(required)
4	| flags		    |	(required)
8	| checksum	    |	(required)
	+-------------------+
8	| header_addr	    |	(present if flags[16] is set)
12	| load_addr	    |	(present if flags[16] is set)
16	| load_end_addr	    |	(present if flags[16] is set)
20	| bss_end_addr	    |	(present if flags[16] is set)
24	| entry_addr	    |	(present if flags[16] is set)
	+-------------------+
</pre>

All fields are in little-endian byte order, of course.  The first field is
the magic number identifying the header, which must be the hex value
0x1BADB002.<P>

The flags field specifies features that the OS image requests or requires
of the boot loader.  Bits 0-15 indicate requirements; if the boot loader
sees any of these bits set but doesn't understand the flag or can't fulfill
the requirements it indicates for some reason, it must notify the user and
fail to load the OS image.  Bits 16-31 indicate optional features; if any
bits in this range are set but the boot loader doesn't understand them, it
can simply ignore them and proceed as usual.  Naturally, all
as-yet-undefined bits in the flags word must be set to zero in OS
images.  This way, the flags fields serves for version control as well as
simple feature selection.<P>

If bit 0 in the flags word is set, then all boot modules loaded along with
the OS must be aligned on page (4KB) boundaries.  Some OS's expect to be
able to map the pages containing boot modules directly into a paged address
space during startup, and thus need the boot modules to be page-aligned.<P>

If bit 1 in the flags word is set, then information on available memory
via at least the 'mem_*' fields of the multiboot_info structure defined
below must be included.  If the bootloader is capable of passing a memory
map (the 'mmap_*' fields) and one exists, then it must be included as
well.<P>

If bit 16 in the flags word is set, then the fields at offsets 8-24 in the
multiboot_header are valid, and the boot loader should use them instead of
the fields in the actual executable header to calculate where to load the
OS image.  This information does not need to be provided if the kernel
image is in ELF format, but it should be provided if the images is in a.out
format or in some other format.  Compliant boot loaders must be able to
load images that either are in ELF format or contain the load address
information embedded in the multiboot_header; they may also directly
support other executable formats, such as particular a.out variants, but
are not required to.<P>

All of the address fields enabled by flag bit 16 are physical addresses.
The meaning of each is as follows:<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>header_addr</B> -- Contains the address corresponding to the
beginning of the multiboot_header - the physical memory location at which
the magic value is supposed to be loaded.  This field serves to "synchronize"
the mapping between OS image offsets and physical memory addresses.
<LI><B>load_addr</B> -- Contains the physical address of the beginning
of the text segment.  The offset in the OS image file at which to start
loading is defined by the offset at which the header was found, minus
(header_addr - load_addr).  load_addr must be less than or equal to
header_addr.
<LI><B>load_end_addr</B> -- Contains the physical address of the end of the
data segment.  (load_end_addr - load_addr) specifies how much data to load.
This implies that the text and data segments must be consecutive in the
OS image; this is true for existing a.out executable formats.
<LI><B>bss_end_addr</B> -- Contains the physical address of the end of
the bss segment.  The boot loader initializes this area to zero, and
reserves the memory it occupies to avoid placing boot modules and other
data relevant to the OS in that area.
<LI><B>entry</B> -- The physical address to which the boot loader should
jump in order to start running the OS.
</UL>

The checksum is a 32-bit unsigned value which, when added to
the other required fields, must have a 32-bit unsigned sum of zero.<P>

<H3>Machine State</H3>

When the boot loader invokes the 32-bit operating system,
the machine must have the following state:<P>

<UL>
<LI>CS must be a 32-bit read/execute code segment with an offset of 0
and a limit of 0xffffffff.
<LI>DS, ES, FS, GS, and SS must be a 32-bit read/write data segment with
an offset of 0 and a limit of 0xffffffff.
<LI>The address 20 line must be usable for standard linear 32-bit
addressing of memory (in standard PC hardware, it is wired to
0 at bootup, forcing addresses in the 1-2 MB range to be mapped to the
0-1 MB range, 3-4 is mapped to 2-3, etc.).
<LI>Paging must be turned off.
<LI>The processor interrupt flag must be turned off.
<LI>EAX must contain the magic value 0x2BADB002; the presence of this value
indicates to the OS that it was loaded by a MultiBoot-compliant boot
loader (e.g. as opposed to another type of boot loader that the OS can
also be loaded from).
<LI>EBX must contain the 32-bit physical address of the multiboot_info
structure provided by the boot loader (see below).
</UL>

All other processor registers and flag bits are undefined.  This includes,
in particular:<P>

<UL>
<LI>ESP: the 32-bit OS must create its own stack as soon as it needs one.
<LI>GDTR: Even though the segment registers are set up as described above,
the GDTR may be invalid, so the OS must not load any segment registers
(even just reloading the same values!) until it sets up its own GDT.
<LI>IDTR: The OS must leave interrupts disabled until it sets up its own IDT.
</UL>

However, other machine state should be left by the boot loader in "normal
working order", i.e. as initialized by the BIOS (or DOS, if that's what
the boot loader runs from).  In other words, the OS should be able to make
BIOS calls and such after being loaded, as long as it does not overwrite
the BIOS data structures before doing so.  Also, the boot loader must leave
the PIC programmed with the normal BIOS/DOS values, even if it changed them
during the switch to 32-bit mode.<P>

<H3>Boot Information Format</H3>

Upon entry to the OS, the EBX register contains the physical address of
a 'multiboot_info' data structure, through which the boot loader
communicates vital information to the OS.  The OS can use or ignore any
parts of the structure as it chooses; all information passed by the boot
loader is advisory only.<P>

The multiboot_info structure and its related substructures may be placed
anywhere in memory by the boot loader (with the exception of the memory
reserved for the kernel and boot modules, of course).  It is the OS's
responsibility to avoid overwriting this memory until it is done using it.<P>

The format of the multiboot_info structure (as defined so far) follows:<P>

<pre>
	+-------------------+
0	| flags		    |	(required)
	+-------------------+
4	| mem_lower	    |	(present if flags[0] is set)
8	| mem_upper	    |	(present if flags[0] is set)
	+-------------------+
12	| boot_device	    |	(present if flags[1] is set)
	+-------------------+
16	| cmdline	    |	(present if flags[2] is set)
	+-------------------+
20	| mods_count	    |	(present if flags[3] is set)
24	| mods_addr	    |	(present if flags[3] is set)
	+-------------------+
28 - 40 | syms		    |   (present if flags[4] or flags[5] is set)
	+-------------------+
44	| mmap_length	    |	(present if flags[6] is set)
48	| mmap_addr	    |	(present if flags[6] is set)
	+-------------------+
</pre>

The first longword indicates the presence and validity of other fields in
the multiboot_info structure.  All as-yet-undefined bits must be set to
zero by the boot loader.   Any set bits that the OS does not understand
should be ignored.  Thus, the flags field also functions as a version
indicator, allowing the multiboot_info structure to be expanded in the
future without breaking anything.<P>

If bit 0 in the multiboot_info.flags word is set, then the 'mem_*' fields
are valid.  'mem_lower' and 'mem_upper' indicate the amount of lower and upper
memory, respectively, in kilobytes.  Lower memory starts at address 0, and
upper memory starts at address 1 megabyte.  The maximum possible
value for lower memory is 640 kilobytes.  The value returned for upper
memory is maximally the address of the first upper memory hole minus
1 megabyte.  It is not guaranteed to be this value.<P>

If bit 1 in the multiboot_info.flags word is set, then the 'boot_device'
field is valid, and indicates which BIOS disk device the boot loader loaded
the OS from.  If the OS was not loaded from a BIOS disk, then this field
must not be present (bit 3 must be clear).  The OS may use this field as a
hint for determining its own "root" device, but is not required to.  The
boot_device field is layed out in four one-byte subfields as follows:<P>

<pre>
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	| drive | part1 | part2 | part3 |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
</pre>

The first byte contains the BIOS drive number as understood by the BIOS
INT 0x13 low-level disk interface: e.g. 0x00 for the first floppy disk or
0x80 for the first hard disk.<P>

The three remaining bytes specify the boot partition.  'part1' specifies
the "top-level" partition number, 'part2' specifies a "sub-partition" in
the top-level partition, etc.  Partition numbers always start from zero.
Unused partition bytes must be set to 0xFF.  For example, if the disk is
partitioned using a simple one-level DOS partitioning scheme, then 'part1'
contains the DOS partition number, and 'part2' and 'part3' are both zero.
As another example, if a disk is partitioned first into DOS partitions, and
then one of those DOS partitions is subdivided into several BSD partitions
using BSD's "disklabel" strategy, then 'part1' contains the DOS partition
number, 'part2' contains the BSD sub-partition within that DOS partition,
and 'part3' is 0xFF.<P>

DOS extended partitions are indicated as partition numbers starting from 4
and increasing, rather than as nested sub-partitions, even though the 
underlying disk layout of extended partitions is hierarchical in nature.
For example, if the boot loader boots from the second extended partition
on a disk partitioned in conventional DOS style, then 'part1' will be 5,
and 'part2' and 'part3' will both be 0xFF.<P>

If bit 2 of the flags longword is set, the 'cmdline' field is valid, and 
contains the physical address of the the command line to be passed to the
kernel.  The command line is a normal C-style null-terminated string.<P>

If bit 3 of the flags is set, then the 'mods' fields indicate to the kernel
what boot modules were loaded along with the kernel image, and where they
can be found.  'mods_count' contains the number of modules loaded;
'mods_addr' contains the physical address of the first module structure.
'mods_count' may be zero, indicating no boot modules were loaded, even if
bit 1 of 'flags' is set.  Each module structure is formatted as follows:<P>

<pre>
	+-------------------+
0	| mod_start	    |
4	| mod_end	    |
	+-------------------+
8	| string	    |
	+-------------------+
12	| reserved (0)	    |
	+-------------------+
</pre>

The first two fields contain the start and end addresses of the boot module
itself.  The 'string' field provides an arbitrary string to be associated
with that particular boot module; it is a null-terminated ASCII string,
just like the kernel command line.  The 'string' field may be 0 if there is
no string associated with the module.  Typically the string might be a
command line (e.g. if the OS treats boot modules as executable programs),
or a pathname (e.g. if the OS treats boot modules as files in a file
system), but its exact use is specific to the OS.  The 'reserved' field
must be set to 0 by the boot loader and ignored by the OS.<P>

NOTE:  Bits 4 & 5 are mutually exclusive.<P>

If bit 4 in the multiboot_info.flags word is set, then the following
fields in the multiboot_info structure starting at byte 28 are valid:<P>

<pre>
	+-------------------+
28	| tabsize	    |
32	| strsize	    |
36	| addr		    |
40	| reserved (0)	    |
	+-------------------+
</pre>

These indicate where the symbol table from an a.out kernel image can be
found.  'addr' is the physical address of the size (4-byte unsigned
long) of an array of a.out-format 'nlist' structures, followed immediately
by the array itself, then the size (4-byte unsigned long) of a set of
null-terminated ASCII strings (plus sizeof(unsigned long) in this case),
and finally the set of strings itself.  'tabsize' is equal to it's size
parameter (found at the beginning of the symbol section), and 'strsize'
is equal to it's size parameter (found at the beginning of the string section)
of the following string table to which the symbol table refers.   Note that
'tabsize' may be 0, indicating no symbols, even if bit 4 in the flags
word is set.<P>

If bit 5 in the multiboot_info.flags word is set, then the following
fields in the multiboot_info structure starting at byte 28 are valid:<P>

<pre>
	+-------------------+
28	| num		    |
32	| size		    |
36	| addr		    |
40	| shndx		    |
	+-------------------+
</pre>

These indicate where the section header table from an ELF kernel is, the
size of each entry, number of entries, and the string table used as the
index of names.  They correspond to the 'shdr_*' entries ('shdr_num', etc.)
in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) specification in the program
header.  All sections are loaded, and the physical address fields
of the elf section header then refer to where the sections are in memory
(refer to the i386 ELF documentation for details as to how to read the
section header(s)).  Note that 'shdr_num' may be 0, indicating no symbols,
even if bit 5 in the flags word is set.<P>

If bit 6 in the multiboot_info.flags word is set, then the 'mmap_*' fields
are valid, and indicate the address and length of a buffer containing a
memory map of the machine provided by the BIOS.  'mmap_addr' is the address,
and 'mmap_length' is the total size of the buffer.  The buffer consists of
one or more of the following size/structure pairs ('size' is really used
for skipping to the next pair):<P>

<pre>
	+-------------------+
-4	| size		    |
	+-------------------+
0	| BaseAddrLow	    |
4	| BaseAddrHigh	    |
8	| LengthLow	    |
12	| LengthHigh	    |
16	| Type		    |
	+-------------------+
</pre>

where 'size' is the size of the associated structure in bytes, which can
be greater than the minimum of 20 bytes.  'BaseAddrLow' is the lower 32
bits of the starting address, and 'BaseAddrHigh' is the upper 32 bits,
for a total of a 64-bit starting address.  'LengthLow' is the lower 32 bits
of the size of the memory region in bytes, and 'LengthHigh' is the upper 32
bits, for a total of a 64-bit length.  'Type' is the variety of address
range represented, where a value of 1 indicates available RAM, and all
other values currently indicated a reserved area.<P>

The map provided is guaranteed to list all standard RAM that should
be available for normal use.<P>

In reference to bit 0 of the multiboot_info.flags parameter,
if the bootloader
in question uses older BIOS interfaces, or the newest ones are not
available (see description about bit 6), then a maximum of either
15 or 63 megabytes of memory may be reported.  It is HIGHLY recommended
that bootloaders perform a thorough memory probe.<P>

In reference to bit 1 of the multiboot_info.flags parameter, it is
recognized that determination of which BIOS drive maps to which
OS-level device-driver is non-trivial, at best.  Many kludges have
been made to various OSes instead of solving this problem, most of
them breaking under many conditions.  To encourage the use of
general-purpose solutions to this problem, here are 2
<A HREF=bios_mapping.txt>BIOS Device Mapping Techniques</A>.<P>

In reference to bit 6 of the multiboot_info.flags parameter, it is
important to note that the data structure used there
(starting with 'BaseAddrLow') is the data returned by the
<A HREF=mem64mb.html>INT 15h, AX=E820h
- Query System Address Map</A> call.  More information
on reserved memory regions is defined on that web page.
The interface here is meant to allow a bootloader to
work unmodified with any reasonable extensions of the BIOS interface,
passing along any extra data to be interpreted by the OS as desired.<P>

<H2><A NAME="example_os">Example OS Code</A> (from Bryan Ford)</H2>

EDITOR'S NOTE:  These examples are relevant to the Proposal version 0.5,
which is basically identical except for the multiboot OS header, which was
missing the checksum.  A patch to bring Mach4 UK22 up to version 0.6 is
available in the GRUB FTP area mentioned in the
<A HREF="#example_boot">Example Bootloader Code</A> section below.<P>

The Mach 4 distribution, available by anonymous FTP from
flux.cs.utah.edu:/flux, contains a C header file that defines the
MultiBoot data structures described above; anyone is welcome to rip it
out and use it for other boot loaders and OS's:<P>

<pre>
        mach4-i386/include/mach/machine/multiboot.h
</pre>

This distribution also contains code implementing a "Linux boot adaptor",
which collects a MultiBoot-compliant OS image and an optional set of boot
modules, compresses them, and packages them into a single traditional Linux
boot image that can be loaded from LILO or other Linux boot loaders.  There
is also a corresponding "BSD boot adaptor" which can be used to wrap a
MultiBoot kernel and set of modules and produce an image that can be loaded
from the FreeBSD and NetBSD boot loaders.  All of this code can be used as-is
or as a basis for other boot loaders.  These are the directories of primary
relevance:<P>

<pre>
        mach4-i386/boot
        mach4-i386/boot/bsd
        mach4-i386/boot/linux
</pre>

The Mach kernel itself in this distribution contains code that demonstrates
how to create a compliant OS.  The following files are of primary
relevance:<P>

<pre>
        mach4-i386/kernel/i386at/boothdr.S
        mach4-i386/kernel/i386at/model_dep.c
</pre>

Finally, I have created patches against the Linux 1.2.2 and FreeBSD 2.0
kernels, in order to make them compliant with this proposed standard.
These patches are available in kahlua.cs.utah.edu:/private/boot.<P>

The <A HREF=http://www.uruk.org/grub/>GRUB</A> bootloader project
will be fully
Multiboot-compliant, supporting all required and optional
features present in this standard.<P>

A final release has not been made, but both the GRUB beta release
(which is quite stable) and a patch for Multiboot version 0.6 for
Mach4 UK22 are available in the GRUB
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.uruk.org/public/grub/>public release</A>
area.<P>
