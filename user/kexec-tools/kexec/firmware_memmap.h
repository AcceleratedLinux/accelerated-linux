 * Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-memmap (kernel tree).
 *
 * The difference between /proc/iomem and /sys/firmware/memmap is that
 * /sys/firmware/memmap provides the raw memory map, provided by the
 * firmware of the system. That memory map should be passed to a kexec'd
 * kernel because the behaviour should be the same as a normal booted kernel,
 * so any limitation (e.g. by the user providing the mem command line option)
 * should not be passed to the kexec'd kernel.
 *
 * The parsing of the code is independent of the architecture. However, the
 * actual architecture-specific code might postprocess the code a bit, like
 * x86 does.

 * false, then one can use the old /proc/iomem interface (for older kernels).
