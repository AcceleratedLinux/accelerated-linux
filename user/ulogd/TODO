libipulog:
X handle multi-part nlmsgs
- Error checking at netlink socket
- forward port my timeout enabled read-function from libipq to libipulog
- man pages

kernel:
X queue the logging in the kernel and send multiple packets in one 
  multipart nlmsg
X add timer to flush queue in user-defineable time intervals
- IPv6 ULOG target

ulogd:
X MYSQL output plugin
X syslog compatibility output plugin
- autoconf-detection of ipt_ULOG.h
X _fini() support for plugin destructors (needed for clean shutdown and 
  SIGHUP configfile reload
X commandline option for "to fork or not to fork"
X various command line options (we don't even have --version)
- add support for capabilities to run as non-root
X big endian fixes
X man pages
- IPv6 support (core and extensions)
X pcap output plugin (to use ethereal/tcpdump/... for the logs)
- enable user to specify directory where to look for kernel include files
- support for static linking
- make core maintain a list of keyid's that all the output plugins are 
  interested.  The interpreters would be called with their respective 
  section of that list, and only compute those values that are actually
  used by any of the running output plugins
- issues with ulogd_BASE and partially copied packets (--ulog-cprange)
- problem wrt. ulogd_BASE and fragments
- implement extension SIGHUP handlers (including config re-parse)

conffile:
- rewrite parser. This stuff is a real mess. Anybody interested?
