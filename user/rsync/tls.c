/**
 * @file tls.c
 *
 * Trivial @c ls for comparing two directories after running an rsync.
 *
 * The problem with using the system's own ls is that some features
 * have little quirks that make directories look different when for
 * our purposes they're the same -- for example, the BSD braindamage
 * about setting the mode on symlinks based on your current umask.
 *
 * All the filenames must be given on the command line -- tls does not
 * even read directories, let alone recurse.  The typical usage is
 * "find|sort|xargs tls".
 *
 * The format is not exactly the same as any particular Unix ls(1).
 *
 * A key requirement for this program is that the output be "very
 * reproducible."  So we mask away information that can accidentally
 * change.
