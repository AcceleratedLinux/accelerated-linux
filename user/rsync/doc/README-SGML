Handling the rsync SGML documentation

rsync documentation is now primarily in Docbook format.  Docbook is an
SGML/XML documentation format that is becoming standard on free
operating systems.  It's also used for Samba documentation.

The SGML files are source code that can be translated into various
useful output formats, primarily PDF, HTML, Postscript and plain text.  

To do this transformation on Debian, you should install the
docbook-utils package.  Having done that, you can say 

  docbook2pdf rsync.sgml

and so on.

On other systems you probably need James Clark's "sp" and "JadeTeX"
packages.  Work it out for yourself and send a note to the mailing
list.
