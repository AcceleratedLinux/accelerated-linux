NEWS for rsync 2.6.6 (28 Jul 2005)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.5:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    - The zlib code was upgraded to version 1.2.3 in order to make it more
      secure.  While the widely-publicized security problem in zlib 1.2.2 did
      not affect rsync, another security problem surfaced that affects rsync's
      zlib 1.1.4.

  BUG FIXES:

    - The setting of flist->high in clean_flist() was wrong for an empty list.
      This could cause flist_find() to crash in certain rare circumstances
      (e.g. if just the right directory setup was around when --fuzzy was
      combined with --link-dest).

    - The outputting of hard-linked files when verbosity was > 1 was not right:
      without -i it would output the name of each hard-linked file as though
      it had been changed (it now outputs a "is hard linked" message for the
      file); with -i it would output all dots for the unchanged attributes of
      a hard-link (it now changes those dots to spaces, as is done for other
      totally unchanged items).

    - When backing up a changed symlink or device, get rid of any old backup
      item so that we don't get an "already exists" error.

    - A couple places that were comparing a local and a remote modification-
      time were not honoring the --modify-window option.

    - Fixed a bug where the 'p' (permissions) itemized-changes flag might get
      set too often (if some non-significant mode bits differed).

    - Fixed a really old, minor bug that could cause rsync to warn about being
      unable to mkdir() a path that ends in "/." because it just created the
      directory (required --relative, --no-implied-dirs, a source path that
      ended in either a trailing slash or a trailing "/.", and a non-existing
      destination dir to tickle the bug in a recent version).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Made the "max verbosity" setting in the rsyncd.conf file settable on a
      per-module basis (which now matches the documentation).

    - The support/rrsync script has been upgraded to verify the args of options
      that take args (instead of rejecting any such options).  The script was
      also changed to try to be more secure and to fix a problem in the parsing
      of a pull operation that has multiple sources.

    - Improved the documentation that explains the difference between a
      normal daemon transfer and a daemon-over remote-shell transfer.

    - Some of the diffs supplied in the patches dir were fixed and/or
      improved.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Made configure define NOBODY_USER (currently hard-wired to "nobody") and
      NOBODY_GROUP (set to either "nobody" or "nogroup" depending on what we
      find in the /etc/group file).

    - Added a test to the test suite, itemized.test, that tests the output of
      -i (log-format w/%i) and some double-verbose messages.
