Greetings, and thanks for all of your work on the wonderful rsync!

I recently had the need to transfer files only with different mod
dates (and to *not* transfer them based on file size differences).
This is because I'm backing up files remotely on an untrusted machine,
so I'm encrypting them with gpg before transfer.  I discovered that
rsync didn't already have a --date-only flag, so I added one and am
enclosing the diffs in case you (as I hope) decide to include this
option in future releases.

Again, thanks!

Best Regards,
Jeremy Bornstein

+dit(bf(--date-only)) Normally rsync will skip any files that are

 dit(bf(--modify-window)) When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the

 value.  This is normally 0 (for an exact match), but you may find it useful
