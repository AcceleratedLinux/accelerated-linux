v1.1.09

  TRUST_PPPD_TO_DIE determins whether we send SIGTERM or SIGKILL, with
  SIGKILL being the (new) default. (ppp-2.4.2-6.4.RHEL4 is known to be
  broken)

* Migration support on xl2tpd.spec for l2tpd -> xl2tpd

v1.1.05
* Changed versioning scheme to match Xelerance standards
* IPsec SA reference tracking added (used with Openswan's IPsec transport mode)
  This adds support for multiple clients behind the same NAT router, and
  multiple clients on the same internal IP behind different NAT routers.
* Fix for Windows clients that send the wrong tunnel ID for closing tunnels

v1.04

v1.03
* fixes for gcc 4.xx compilation

v1.02

  will block due to routing loops

* move all logic about pty usage to pty.c try ptmx first. if it fails try
  legacy ptys
* rename log() to l2tp_log(), as "log" is a math function.

* If we aren't deamonized, then log to stderr.
* added install: and DESTDIR support
