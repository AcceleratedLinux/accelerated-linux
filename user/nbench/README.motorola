The information in this file is old and no longer valid. It seems that
the GNU C library has caught up with Motorola's libmoto, and now
performance is just as good (or better) without libmoto. I'll include
the old notice out of historical reasons only. Currently libmoto is
available at ftp://ftp.mcg.mot.com/pub/SPS/PowerPC/software/mklinux/libmoto/,
but this is subject to change and not under my control.

If you have a Motorola CPU or equivalent:

When linked with the 'libmoto' (floating point library from Motorola)
the results you obtain are much better. (FPU index of 0.896 versus
1.910 in one example.)

The Motorola math library is currently available at:
http://www.mot.com/SPS/PowerPC/support/rsw_customer_support/mklinux/libmoto/libmoto_reg_mkdev.html

If you have a Motorola CPU and you submit a result then please let me
know whether you used libmoto or not. Please read the file README.submit.

I do not have a Motorola CPU, and I can't help you with installing the
library either.
