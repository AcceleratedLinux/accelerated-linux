I plan on posting a digest of results in case people mail me any.
The URL will be linked to

If you want to submit, then run the benchmark (use your own
compilation, I don't care with what flags or compiler, but I want all
numbers from a single benchmark run) and fill in the template as given
in the example below:

CPU                             : AMD 5x86P75 (486DX4/133MHz)
L2 CACHE                        : 256 KB
OS                              : Linux 2.0.32
C COMPILER                      : gcc 2.7.2.3
LIBC                            : libc-5.4.38
Pentium 90 INTEGER INDEX        : 1.051
Pentium 90 FLOATING-POINT INDEX : 0.450
AMD K6/233 MEMORY INDEX         : 0.337
AMD K6/233 INTEGER INDEX        : 0.238
AMD K6/233 FLOATING-POINT INDEX : 0.230

Any other format is fine as long as it contains the same info (write
"unknown" or "?" for data you don't know). For example, you could just
cut the summary from the output of nbench and mail it together with
cache, CPU, and OS info in case it is not already present. Please do
not email me the complete output of nbench, or any other unnecessarily
long email, as this just eats up my hard-disk space.  However, long
collections of results are of course welcome.

Send your result to mayer@tux.org
