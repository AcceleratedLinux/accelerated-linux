Welcome to the Sprite sample application for Larry Wall's JPL. This
application showcases a merging of Java and Perl in which Java is employed
to generate a user interface, and Perl is used for data access.
Specifically, Perl is used with Shishir Gundavaram's Sprite module to offer
permanent storage through SQL manipulation of text files. This application
is a Rolodex(tm)-style address file, offering the ability to add, edit or
delete names and addresses. You may also navigate through the address list.

To use this example, you will need to install the Sprite module from CPAN.

To install the sample, you must first have JPL installed and working.
Please ensure that you have set environment variables as directed in the
JPL README and that the JPL Sample program works. Once this has been
accomplished, you can build the files in this directory with the following
commmands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

You can run this by typing:

    java JPL_Rolo

The application should appear with some sample data, and you can mess
around with it and put all your friends in the address book. Far out!
