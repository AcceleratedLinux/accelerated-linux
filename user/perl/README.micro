microperl is supposed to be a really minimal perl, even more
minimal than miniperl.  No Configure is needed to build microperl,
on the other hand this means that interfaces between Perl and your
operating system are left very -- minimal.

All this is experimental.  If you don't know what to do with microperl
you probably shouldn't.  Do not report bugs in microperl; fix the bugs.

We assume ANSI C89 plus the following:
- <stdlib.h>
- rename()
- opendir(), readdir(), closedir() (via dirent.h)
- memchr (via string.h)
- (a safe) putenv() (via stdlib.h)
- strtoul() (via stdlib.h)
(grep for 'define' in uconfig.sh.)
Also, Perl times() is defined to always return zeroes.

If you are still reading this and you are itching to try out microperl:

	make -f Makefile.micro

If you make changes to uconfig.sh, run

	make -f Makefile.micro regen_uconfig

to regenerate uconfig.h.
