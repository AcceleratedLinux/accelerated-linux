0.77	Sat Jun  8 22:58:56 CEST 2002

	- Since Attribute::Handlers now is core, I will refer to changes
	with their patch number, please read  Porting/repository.pod from
	your a perl tarball for more information.

	- Brought up to date with perl 5.8RC1 version 
	will be 5.8 if no more changes come in

	- [#13686] This changes the behaviour of lexical attributes.
	Prior to this lexical attributes were done at a compile time, 
	and they would loose their attribute on the next run over them.
	Now perl 5.8 calls the attribute handler runtime whenever it hits my.

	- [#14448] Fixes cases with too high refcounts on lexical attributes

	- [#15945] Do not warn about too late CHECK and INIT block if
	A::H is pulled in using a require.

0.78	Sat Oct  5 07:18:09 CEST 2002
	
	- [#17940] Includes :unique and :shared in the builtin types

	- From perl 5.8 { __CALLER__::foo => __PACKAGE } is missparsed,
	the proper approach is to use  { '__CALLER__::foo' => __PACKAGE }.
	The documentation is updated to reflect this.
