Does inplace edit of diff files output by the perforce commands
"p4 describe", "p4 diff", and "p4 diff2". The result is suitable
for feeding to the "patch" program.

If no files are specified, reads from stdin and writes to stdout.

WARNING: It only handles context or unified diffs.

Example: p4 describe -du 123 | $0 > change-123.patch
