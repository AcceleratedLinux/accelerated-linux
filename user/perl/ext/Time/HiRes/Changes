Revision history for Perl extension Time::HiRes.

1.86	[2005-12-17]
	- HiRes.t:s/ok 32/ok 33/, from Dominic Dunlop
	- tighten up the clock() test marginally by requiring non-negative
	- clock_nanosleep() and clock() doc tweaks

1.85	[2005-12-16]
	- the interface to clock_nanosleep() is more natural
	  when it is like (hires) time() (instead of like nanosleep),
	  and the .xs implementation of clock_nanosleep() in 1.84
	  was broken anyway
	- the semantics of clock() are not quite so silly as I thought,
	  but still somewhat odd, documented as such
	- additional enhancements to the clock() documentation
	- add test for clock_nanosleep() (I cannot test this
	  since none of my systems have the function)
	- add test for clock()

1.84	[2005-12-16]
	- add clock() which returns the processor time in
	  (floating point) seconds since an arbitrary era
	- add clock_nanosleep() which suspends the current
	  thread until either absolute time or for relative time
	- [rt.cpan.org #16486] printf missing value in HiRes.t
	- add constants CLOCKS_PER_SEC, CLOCK_SOFTTIME, TIMER_ABSTIME
	- tiny typo fixes

1.83	[2005-11-19]
	- has_symbol() was wrong since e.g. ITIMER_VIRTUAL is exported
	  via @EXPORT_OK even when it is not available.  This is heinous.
	  @EXPORT_OK should be determined at Makefile.PL time.
	- be more lenient is testing clock_gettime(): allow more slop,
	  and retry up to three times, sleeping a random nap between
	  the retries
	- human months are one-based (noticed by Anton Berezin)

1.82	[2005-10-06]
	- CLOCK_REALTIME is an enum value (of the clockid_t enum)
	  in HP-UX (and might be so elsewhere, too), debugged by
	  H. Merijn Brand
	- include const-c.inc as late as possible (from Randy Kobes,
	  [rt.cpan.org #15552] to avoid undefined usleep() on Win32

1.81	[2005-11-05]
	- try to be more robust and consistent in the detection of
          CLOCK_REALTIME and ITIMER_VIRTUAL in HiRes.t: the proper
	  way is

		sub has_symbol {
		    my $symbol = shift;
		    eval 'import Time::HiRes qw($symbol)';
		    return 0 unless $@ eq '';
		    return exists ${"Time::HiRes::$symbol"};
		}

	  and then use

		&FOO_BAR

	  in the test.  All these moves are needed because

	  1) one cannot directly do eval 'Time::HiRes::FOO_BAR'
	     because FOO_BAR might have a true value of zero
	     (or in the general case an empty string or even undef)

	  2) In case FOO_BAR is not available in this platform,
	     &FOO_BAR avoids the bareword warning

	- wait more (1.5 seconds instead of 0.1) for the CLOCK_REALTIME test
	  but expect the 'customary' slop of 0.20 instead of 0.25
	- fixed inside a comment HAS_POLL -> TIME_HIRES_NANOSLEEP
	- at the end of HiRest.t tell how close we were to termination

1.80	[2005-11-04]
	- Gisle noticed a mistake (using HAS_NANOSLEEP) in 1.79

1.79	[2005-11-03]
	- try nanosleep for emulating usleep -- may help in some weird
	  embedded realtime places which have nanosleep but neither usleep
	  nor select nor poll (doesn't have to be weird embedded realtime
	  place, though -- in many places usleep is nanosleep anyway)
	- try poll for emulating usleep -- this may help some obscure/old
	  SVR4 places that have neither usleep nor select
	- a redundant test guard in HiRes.t

1.78	[2005-11-03]
	- ITIMER_VIRTUAL detection in HiRes.t had problems (that we cannot
	  in the general case fail already at 'use' phase is suboptimal)
	- fixes to the documentation of clock_gettime() and clock_getres()

1.77	[2005-11-03]
	- add support for the POSIX clock_gettime() and clock_getres(),
	  if available, either as library calls or as syscalls
	- be more defensive about missing functionality: break out
	  early (during 'use') if no e.g. clock_getres() is available,
	  and protect our back by trapping those cases also in HiRes.xs
	- the test added in 1.76 could cause an endless loop e.g. in Solaris,
	  due to mixing of sleep() and alarm() (bad programmer, no cookie!)

1.76	[2005-10-22]
	- testing for nanosleep had wrong logic which caused nanosleep
	  to become undefined for e.g. Mac OS X
	- added a test for a core dump that was introduced by Perl 5.8.0
	  safe signals and was fixed for the time of 5.8.1 (one report of
	  the core dump was [perl #20920]), the test skipped pre-5.8.1.
	- *cough* s/unanosleep/nanosleep/g; *cough*

1.75	[2005-10-18]
	- installation patch from Gisle Aas: in Perls 5.8.x and later
	  use MakeMaker INSTALLDIRS value of 'perl' instead of 'site'.

1.74	[2005-09-19]
	- [cpan #14608] Solaris 8 perl 5.005_03 File::Spec module does not have method rel2abs
	  (the workaround is not to use rel2abs, should not be necessary)
	- [cpan #14642] U2time wrongly exported on the C API
	  (patch supplied by the reporter, SALVA@cpan.org)
	- add release dates to Changes

1.73	[2005-08-16]
	- Time::HiRes::nanosleep support for Solaris [PATCH]
	  (POSIX::uname() not available if building with core perl,
	   from Gisle Aas, via perl5-porters, perl change #25295)

1.72	[2005-07-01]
	- going back to the 1.68 loader setup (using DynaLoader)
	  since too many weird things starting breaking
	- fix a typo in José Auguste-Etienne's name

1.71	[2005-06-28]
	- a thinko in the nanosleep() detection
	- move more changes stuff from the README to Changes
	- add -w to the Makefile.PL

1.70	[2005-06-26]
	- oops in 1.69 about @ISA (not affecting anything but silly)
	- add copyright 2005 to HiRes.pm
	- add copyright and license to HiRes.xs
	- add copyrights 2003, 2004, 2005 to README

1.69	[2005-06-25]
	- actually run a test for nanosleep
	  (if there is no $Config{d_nanosleep}) since e.g. in AIX 4.2
	  it seems that one can link in nanosleep() but then calling
	  it fails instantly and sets errno to ENOSYS (Not implemented).
	  This may be fixable in the AIX case by figuring out the right
	  (realtime POSIX?) libs and whatnot, but in the general case
	  running a real test case is better.  (Of course, this change
	  will no doubt run into portability problems because of the
	  execution step...)  Note that because of hysterical raisins
	  most Perls do NOT have $Config{d_nanosleep} (scanning for
	  it by Configure would in many platforms require linking in
	  things like -lrt, which would in many platforms be a bad idea
	  for Perl itself).
	  (from José Auguste-Etienne)
	- support XSLoader also since it's much faster
	  (from Alexey Tourbin)
	- add SEE ALSO (BSD::Resource and Time::TAI64)

1.68	[2005-05-14]
	- somehow 1.67 had a lot of doubled lines (a major cut-and-paste
	  error suspected), but miraculously it still worked since the
	  doubling took place below the __END__ token
	- undef Pause() before defining it to avoid redefinition warnings
	  during compilation in case perl.h had already defined Pause()
	  (part of perl change #24271)
	- minor doc tweaks

1.67	[2005-05-04]
	- (internal) don't ignore the return value of gettimeofday()
	- (external) return undef or an empty if the C gettimeofday() fails
	  (affects Time::HiRes gettimeofday() and the hires time())

1.66	[2004-12-19]
	- add nanosleep()
	- fix the 'hierachy' typo in Makefile.PL [rt.cpan.org #8492]
	- should now build in Solaris [rt.cpan.org #7165] (since 1.64)
	- should now build in Cygwin [rt.cpan.org #7535] (since 1.64)
	- close also [rt.cpan.org #5933] "Time::HiRes::time does not
	  pick up time adjustments like ntp" since ever reproducing it
	  (and therefore verifying a possible fix) in the same environment 
	  has become rather unlikely

1.65	[2004-09-18]
	- one should not mix u?alarm and sleep (the tests modified
	  by 1.65, #12 and #13, hung in Solaris), now we just busy
	  loop executing an empty block
	- in the documentation underline the unspecificity of mixing
	  sleeps and alarms
	- small spelling fixes

1.64	[2004-09-16]
	- regenerate ppport.h with Devel::PPPort 3.03,
	  now the MY_CXT_CLONE is defined in ppport.h,
	  we no more need to do that.

	- the test #12 would often hang in sigsuspend() (at least that's
	  where Mac OS X' ktrace shows it hanging).  With the sleep()s
	  changed to sleep(1)s, the tests still pass but no hang after
	  a few hundred repeats.

1.63	[2004-09-01]
	- Win32 and any ithread build: ppport.h didn't define
	  MY_CXT_CLONE, which seems to be a Time-HiRes-ism.

1.62	[2004-08-31]
	- Skip testing if under PERL_CORE and Time::HiRes has not
	  been Configured (from Marcus Holland-Moritz, core change
	  #23246)
	- Use ppport.h generated by Devel::PPPort 3.01,
	  allowing cutting away our own portability code.
	- Don't use $ENV{PERL_CORE} for < 5.6.0.
	- Don't use "for my $i" for <= 5.003.
	- Don't use Pause() for <= 5.003.
	- Can't use newSVpvf for <= 5.003.
	(most of the changes from Marcus)

1.61	[2004-08-21]
	- Win32: reset reading from the performance counters every
	  five minutes to better track wall clock time (thanks to
	  PC timers being often quite bad), should help long-running
	  programs.

1.60	[2004-08-15]
	- Win32: Patch from Steve Hay
	  [PATCH] Re: [perl #30755] [Win32] Different results from Time::HiRes::gettimeofdayunder the debugger
	  to [perl #30755] reported by Nigel Sandever

	- Cygwin: Use the Win32 recalibration code also in Cygwin if the
	  <w32api/windows.h> APIs are available.  Cygwin testing by
	  Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes.

	- Solaris: use -lposix4 to get nanosleep for Solaris 2.6,
	  after that keep using -lrt, patch from Alan Burlison,
	  bug reported in [cpan #7165]

1.59	[2004-04-08]
	- Change the Win32 recalibration limit to 0.5 seconds and tweak
	  the documentation to blather less about the gory details of the
	  Win32 implementation and more about the complications in general
	  of meddling with the system clock.

1.58	[2004-04-08]
	- Document the 1.57 change better.

1.57	[2004-07-04]
	- Win32/Cygwin/MinGW: if the performance counter drifts by more
	  than two seconds from the system clock (due to ntp adjustments,
	  for example), recalibrate our internal counter: from Jan Dubois,
	  based on [cpan #5933] by Jerry D. Hedden.

1.56	[2004-29-02]
	- Give a clearer message if the tests timeout (perl change #22253)
	- Don't use /tmp or its moral equivalents (perl bug #15036,
	  perl change #22258)

1.55	[2004-01-14]
	- Windows: mingw32 patch from Mike Pomraning (use Perl's Const64()
	  instead of VC-specific i64 suffix)

1.54	[2003-12-31]
	- Solaris: like Tru64 (dec_osf) also Solaris need -lrt for nanosleep

1.53	[2003-12-30]
	- Windows: higher resolution time() by using the Windows
	  performance counter API, from Jan Dubois and Anton Shcherbinin.
	  The exact new higher resolution depends on the hardware,
	  but it should be quite a bit better than using the basic
	  Windows timers.

1.52	[2003-10-28]
	- In AIX (v?) with perl 5.6.1 the HiRes.t can hang after
	  the subtest 18.  No known analysis nor fix, but added
	  an alarm (that requires fork() and alarm()) to the test.

1.51	[2003-09-22]
	- doc tweaks from mjd (perl change #20456)
	- NCR MP-RAS hints file added (svr4.pl) (perl change #21249)

1.50	[2003-08-02]
	- add a message (for non-core builds) to Makefile.PL about
	  the LC_ALL=C workaround
	- &Time::HiRes::d_nanosleep was broken (perl change #20131)
	- the nanosleep() probe was broken (perl change #20061)
	- use existence instead of definedness for feature probes
	  (perl change #20043)
	- MPE/iX tweak (perl change #20042)
	- do not use HAS_NANOSLEEP (perl change #19898)

1.49	[2003-06-23]
	- UVuf for non-IVSIZE platforms (from Keiichiro Nagano)
	- OS/2 can always mix subsecond sleeps with signals
	  (part of perl change #19789)

1.48	[2003-06-04]
	- workaround for buggy gcc 2.95.3 in openbsd/sparc64
	  (perl change #19592)

1.47	[2003-05-03]
	- do not use -lrt in Linux (from March Lehmann, perl change #19449)
		- unnecessary (nanosleep is in libc anyway)
		- harmful (-lrt slows down execution)
		- incompatible (with many distributions' pthreads)

1.46	[2003-04-25]
	- do not create files in blib directories under core
	  (perl change #19160, from rgs)
	- detypo s/VTLARM/VTARLM/ (perl change #19328, from mjd)

1.45	[2003-04-01]
	- guarantee that $xdefine in HiRes.t is always defined
	  (perl change #19109, from IlyaZ)
	- a cleaner way to detect PERL_CORE (perl change #19111,
	  from IlyaZ)

1.44	[2003-03-30]
	- add hints/irix.pl to turn off overly POSIX flags that
	  cause hide struct timespec to be hidden (and compilation
	  to fail) (bleadperl change #19085)
	- documentation tweaks

1.43	[2003-03-11]
	- add c:/temp to the list of temp directories to probe
	  so that cygwin (and win*?) builds are happy.  This was
	  needed at least in my cygwin 1.3.20/w2k setup.

1.42	[2003-01-07]
	- modernize the constants code (from Nicholas Clark)

1.41	[2003-01-03]
	- At some point the ability to figure our the correct incdir
	  for EXTERN.h (either a core perl build, or an installed perl)
	  had broken (which lead into all test compiles failing with
	  a core perl build, but thanks to the robustness of Makefile.PL
	  nothing of this was visible).  The brokenness seemed to be
	  caused by $ENV{PERL_CORE} not being on for core builds?
	  Now stole a trick from the Encode that sets $ENV{PERL_CORE}
	  right, and both styles of build should work again.

1.40	[2003-01-03]
	- Nicholas Clark noticed that the my_catdir() emulation function
	  was broken (which means that we didn't really work for Perls
	  5.002 and 5.003)
	- inspired by fixing the above made the whole Makefile.PL -w
	  and strict clean
	- tightened up the Makefile.PL output, less whitespace

1.39	[2003-10-20]
	- fix from Craig Berry for better building in VMS with PERL_CORE

1.38	[2003-10-13]
	- no functional changes
	- move lib/Time/HiRes.pm as Hires.pm
	- libraries scanning was slightly broken (always scanned
	  for a library even when $Config{libs} already had it)

1.37	[2003-09-23]
	- Ray Zimmerman ran into a race condition in Mac OS X.
	  A 0.01-second alarm fired before the test expected.
	  The test first slept indefinitely (blocking for signals)
	  and only after that tested for the signal having been sent.
	  Since the signal had already been sent, the test #12 never
	  completed.  The solution: test first, then block.
	- default to being silent on all probing attempts, set the
	  environment variable VERBOSE to a true value to see the
	  details (the probing command and the possible errors)

1.36	[2003-09-12]
	- do not clear MAN3PODS in Makefile.PL (Radoslaw Zielinski)
	- INSTALLDIRS => 'perl' missing which means that Time::HiRes
	  cannot be upgraded from CPAN to override the 5.8.0 version
	  (Guido A. Ostkamp)
	- Time::HiRes 1.35 could not be dropped as-is to bleadperl
	  because the include directories did not adjust themselves
	  if $ENV{PERL_CORE} (Hugo van der Sanden)
	- add documentation about the restart of select() under alarm()

1.35	[2003-08-24]
	- small documentation tweaks


1.34	[2003-08-22]
	- better VMS operation (Craig Berry)

1.33	[2003-08-20]
	- our time machine is accelerating: now works with Perl 5.004_01
	  (tried with 5.003_07 and 5.002 but I get segmentation faults
	   from running the Makefile.PL with those in Tru64 4.0D)

1.32	[2003-08-20]
	- backward compatibility (pre-5.6.0) tweaks:
	  - no XSLoader in 5.00503, use DynaLoader instead
	  - no SvPV_nolen, either
	  - no PerlProc_pause(), either
	  - now tested with 5.00404 and 5.00503
	  - Makefile.PL requires 5.00404 (no more 5.002)
	- use nanosleep instead of usleep, if it is available (Wilson Snyder)
	  (this means that one can mix subsecond sleeps with alarms)
	- because of nanosleep we probe for -lrt and -lposix4
	- the existence of getitimer/nanosleep/setitimer/ualarm/usleep
	  is available by exportable constants Time::HiRes::d_func
	  (since older Perl do not have them in %Config, and even
	   5.8.0 does not probe for nanosleep)

1.31	[2003-08-19]
	- backward compatibility (pre-5.6.1) tweaks:
	  - define NV if no NVTYPE
	  - define IVdf if needed (note: the Devel::PPPort
	    in 5.8.0 does not try hard hard enough since
	    the IVSIZE might not be defined)
	  - define NVgf if needed
	  - grab the typemap from 5.8.0 for the NV stuff

	1.31 and 1.32 add more backward compatibility (now all the way
	back to Perl 5.00404), and using nanosleep() (if available) for
	subsecond sleeps.

1.30	[2003-08-16]

	- release 1.29_02 as 1.30

	1.30 adds all the changes made during the Perl 5.6->5.7->5.8
	development cycle.  Most notably portability across platforms has been
	enhanced, and the interval timers (setitimer, getitimer) have been
	added.  Note that the version of Time::HiRes that is included in Perl
	5.8.0 calls itself 1.20_00, but it is equivalent to this Time::HiRes
	version.  Note also that in 1.30 Wegscheid turns over the maintenance
	to Jarkko Hietaniemi.

1.29_02	[2003-08-16]

	- fix a silly unclosed comment typo in HiRes.xs
	- document and export REALTIME_REALPROF (Solaris)

1.29_01	[2003-08-16]

	- only getitimer(ITIMER_REAL) available in Cygwin and Win32
	  (need to patch this also in Perl 5.[89])
	- remove CVS revision log from HiRes.xs

1.29_00	[2003-08-14]

	-  9708: test also the scalar aspect of getitimer()
	-  9705: Add interval timers (setitimer, getitimer)
	-  9692: do not require at least 5.005 using XS
		 
	The following changes were made on top of the changes
	made for Time::HiRes during the Perl 5.7 development
	cycle that culminated in the release of Perl 5.8.0. 

	- add "require 5.005" to the Makefile.PL
	- remove the REVISION section (CVS log) from HiRes.pm
	- add jhi's copyright alongside Douglas'
	- move HiRes.pm to lib/Time/
	- move HiRes.t to t/
	- modify HiRes.t to use $ENV{PERL_CORE}
	- modify the original Time::HiRes version 1.20 Makefile.PL
	  to work both with Perl 5.8.0 and the new code with pre-5.8.0
	  Perls (tried with 5.6.1)
	- tiny tweaks and updates in README and TODO
	- bump the VERSION to 1.29

1.20  Wed Feb 24 21:30 1999
	- make our usleep and ualarm substitutes into hrt_usleep 
	  and hrt_ualarm. This helps static links of Perl with other
	  packages that also have usleep, etc. From
	  Ilya Zakharevich <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>
	- add C API stuff. From Joshua Pritikin
	  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>
	- VMS Makefile.PL fun.	From pvhp@forte.com (Peter Prymmer)
	- hopefully correct "-lc" fix for SCO.
	- add PPD stuff

	1.20 adds a platform neutral set of C accessible routines if you are
	running 5.005+.  All other changes are packaging changes and build
	fixes(?) for statically linked Perl, SCO, and VMS.

1.19  Tue Sep 29 22:30 1998
	- put VMS gettimeofday() in. Patch is from Sebastian Bazley
	  <seb@stian.demon.co.uk>
	- change GIMME_V to GIMME to help people with older versions of
	  Perl.
	- fix Win32 version of gettimeofday(). It didn't affect anything,
	  but it confuses people reading the code when the return value
	  is backwards (0 is success).
	- fix Makefile.PL (more) so that detection of gettimeofday is
	  more correct.

	1.19 has better VMS support.

1.18  Mon Jul 6 22:40 1998
	- add usleep() for Win32.
	- fix Makefile.PL to fix reported HP/UX feature where unresolved
	  externals still cause an executable to be generated (though no
	  x bit set). Thanks to David Kozinn for report and explanation.
	  Problems with the fix are mine :)

	1.18 has limited Win32 support (no ualarm). Added usleep for Win32.
	Probably buggy. I'm sure I'll hear.

1.17  Wed Jul 1 20:10 1998
	- fix setitimer calls so microseconds is not more than 1000000.
	  Hp/UX 9 doesn't like that. Provided by Roland B Robert, PhD.
	- make Win32. We only get gettimeofday (the select hack doesn't
	  seem to work on my Win95 system).
	- fix test 4 on 01test.t. add test to see if time() and 
	  Time::HiRes::time() are close.

1.16  Wed Nov 12 21:05 1997
	- add missing EXTEND in new gettimeofday scalar code.

	1.16+ should be closer to building out of the box on Linux. Thanks
	to Gisle Aas for patches, and the ualarm equivalent using setitimer.

	If your underlying operating system doesn't implement ualarm(), then
	a fake using setitimer() will be made.  If the OS is missing usleep(),
	a fake one using select() will be made. If a fake can't be made for
	either ualarm() or usleep(), then the corresponding Perl function will
	not be available.  If the OS is missing gettimeofday(), you will get
	unresolved externals, either at link- or run-time.

	This is an improvement; the package used to not even build if
	you were missing any of these bits. Roderick Schertler

	<roderick@argon.org> did all the conditional compilation stuff,
	look at HiRes.pm and the test suites; it's good educational reading.

1.15  Mon Nov 10 21:30 1997
	- HiRes.pm: update pod. Provided by Gisle Aas.
	- HiRes.xs: if gettimeofday() called in scalar context, do
	  something more useful than before. Provided by Gisle Aas.
	- README: tell of xsubpp '-nolinenumber' woes. thanks to
	  Edward Henigin <ed@texas.net> for pointing out the problem.

1.14  Wed Nov 5 9:40 1997
	- Makefile.PL: look for setitimer
	- HiRes.xs: if missing ualarm, but we have setitimer, make up
	  our own setitimer. These were provided by Gisle Aas.

1.13  Tue Nov 4 23:30 1997
	- Makefile.PL: fix autodetect mechanism to do try linking in addition
	  to just compiling; should fix Linux build problem. Fix was provided
	  by Gisle Aas.

1.12  Sun Oct 12 12:00:00 1997
	- Makefile.PL: set XSOPT to '-nolinenumbers' to work around xsubpp bug;
	  you may need to comment this back out if you have an older xsubpp.
	- HiRes.xs: set PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

1.11  Fri Sep 05 16:00:00 1997
	- Makefile.PL:
	  Had some line commented out that shouldn't have been (testing
	  remnants)
	- README:
	  Previous version was corrupted.

1.10  Thu May 22 20:20:00 1997
	- HiRes.xs, HiRes.pm, t/*:
	      -	only compile what we have OS support for (or can 
		fake with select())
	      - only test what we compiled 
	      - gross improvement to the test suite
	      - fix EXPORT_FAIL. 
	  This work was all done by Roderick Schertler
	  <roderick@argon.org>. If you run Linux or
	  one of the other ualarm-less platforms, and you like this 
	  module, let Roderick know; without him, it still wouldn't 
	  be working on those boxes...
	- Makefile.PL: figure out what routines the OS has and
	  only build what we need. These bits were written by Jarkko 
	  Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>. Again, gratitude is due...

1.02  Mon Dec 30 08:00:00 1996
	- HiRes.pm: update documentation to say what to do when missing
	  ualarm() and friends.
	- README: update to warn that ualarm() and friends need to exist

1.01  Fri Oct 17 08:00:00 1996
	- Makefile.PL: make XSPROTOARGS => '-noprototyopes'
	- HiRes.pm: put blank line between __END__ and =head1 so that 
	  pod2man works.

1.00  Tue Sep 03 13:00:00 1996
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16
