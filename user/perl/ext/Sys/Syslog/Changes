Revision history for Sys-Syslog

0.13    2006.01.11
        [CODE] Merged blead@26768: If getservbyname fails tell what service 
        the lookup attempt tried to use.
        [CODE] Merged blead@26769: suppress Sys::Hostname usage and directly 
        use INADDR_LOOPBACK.
        [CODE] Merged blead@26772: $host needs to stay in case the user sets it.
        [CODE] Merged blead@26773: check that $syslog_path is a socket.
        [TESTS] RT#16980 (Alan Burlison): Sys::Syslog blows up rather 
        spectacularly on Solaris. Corrected by previous patches. 
        [TESTS] Applied Gisle Aas patch for a better handling of error messages,
        then optimized it. 
        [TESTS] RT#16974: Failed test in t/podspell. This test is now skipped.

0.12    2006.01.07
        [CODE] Merged some modifications from bleadperl.
        [DOC] Added a link to an article about Sys::Syslog.
        [TESTS] Removed optional dependency on Test::Exception.
        [TESTS] Improved t/constant.t
        [TESTS] Rewrote t/constants.t because future versions of 
        ExtUtils::Constant will prevent the constant() function from 
        being directly called.

0.11    2005.12.28
        [BUGFIX] setlogmask() now behaves like its C counterpart.

        [CODE] Support for three Exporter tags.
        [CODE] XSLoader is now optional.

        [DIST] Merged change from blead@26343

        [DIST] CPANized from blead@26281.
        [DIST] Modified Makefile.PL so that ExtUtils::Constant is conditionaly

        [DOC] Added support and license information.
