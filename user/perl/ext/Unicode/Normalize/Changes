Revision history for Perl extension Unicode::Normalize.

0.32  Tue Apr  5 22:47:09 2005
    - Some literal and grammatical errors in POD are fixed.

0.31  Tue Apr  5 21:43:20 2005
    - CAVEATS in POD is added.
    - Some test cases from Unicode Public Review Issue #29
      (Normalization Issue) are added to norm.t and test.t.
    - do 'mkheader' returns true so that Makefile.PL will catch error.
    - META.yml is added.

0.30  Sun May  2 14:35:00 2004
    - XSUB: (perl 5.8.1 or later) improved utf8 upgrade of non-POK
      (private POK) values like tied scalars, overloaded objects, etc.

0.28  Sat Nov 22 23:46:24 2003
    - XSUB: even if string contains a malformed, "short" Unicode character,
      decompose() and reorder() will be safe. Garbage will be no longer added.
    - added null.t and short.t.
    - now truely added illegal.t (in 0.27, forgot to change MANIFEST).

0.27  Sun Nov 16 13:16:21 2003
    - Illegal code points (surrogate and noncharacter) will be allowed
      (keep your code with <no warnings 'utf8';>);
      but porting is not successful in the case of ((Pure Perl) and
      (Perl 5.7.3 or before)).
    - added illegal.t.

0.26  Sat Nov 15 21:52:30 2003
    - doc fix: s/FCD(?= is unique)/FCC/;

0.25  Mon Oct  6 22:26:03 2003
    - added form.t and proto.t.

0.24  Sat Oct  4 17:57:10 2003
    - supports FCD and FCC (UTN #5):
      FCD(), normalize('FCD'), checkFCD(), check('FCD');
      FCC(), normalize('FCC'), checkFCC(), check('FCC').
    - changed INSTALLATION (cf. README).
      * Initial state of the distribution is changed to XSUB.  To build
        pure Perl, type <perl disableXS> before <perl Makefile.PL>.
      * The purePerl-XSUB converter is now provided as two perl
        script files, named "enableXS" and "disableXS".
        (no longer <perl Makefile.PL xs> and <perl Makefile.PL noxs>.)
      * simplified Makefile.PL.
    - added fcdc.t and split.t.

0.23  Sat Jun 28 20:38:10 2003
