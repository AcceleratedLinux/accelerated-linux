Many thanks to:

Peter Bechtold, peter@fns.greenie.muc.de, for sending me dozens of faxes
	to test mgetty, for calling me back numerous times after failed
	attempts to send him a fax with sendfax, ...

Klaus Weidner, klaus@greenie.muc.de, for the original linux port,
	and for testing dozens of pre-releases

Lawrence 'dreamer' Chen, lawrence@combdyn.com, for the initial ISC port,
	and for testing the package with a SupraFAX-Modem.

Kay, kschulz@gold.t-informatik.ba-stuttgart.de, for testing on ISC - and
	telling me that it's possible to ask dozens of questions without
	having ever read the README file...

Georg Edelmann, georg@alpha.saar.de, for testing on Linux, and finding
	some stupid bugs

Uwe S. Obst, sysop@ganymed.phiger.com, for testing on SCO 3.2.4 and
	finding the only working way to set the hardware flow control flags
	(Other combinations seem to always prevent parallel dial-outs)

Bodo Bauer, bodo@hal.nbg.sub.org, for porting mgetty to SVR4 (though he
	did quite confuse me by insisting that the fax receiver does
	not work...)

Christoph Adomeit, for bugging me long enough to implement XON / XOFF
	flow control in fax sending / receiving, and buffered reads in fax
	receiving; and for borrowing me one of his GVC modems long enough
	to make faxing work with it.

Christopher M. Ward, for testing on SCO with another GVC modem.

... and to all others who tested release after release.

(The list here is incomplete, a more complete list can be found in
mgetty.texi)
