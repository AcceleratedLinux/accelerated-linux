tkvoice is a Tcl/Tk frontend to vgetty. Its advantage over competitors
such as kvoice is the desktop independance, and possibly much more.

The tkvoice home page is at http://tkvoice.netfirms.com/

This was sent to me by Peter BRULEY <pbruley@highstream.net>, for inclusion
into mgetty/vgetty. Unfortunately, its size doesn't allow us to distribute
it directly.

You can find it on ftp://alpha.greenie.net/pub/mgetty/tools/tkvoice-1.3.tar.gz
(and look for more recent versions there).
