Sorry that there is no really usable manual for vgetty. Maybe someone
could volunteer ?  In the meantime, use the following source
of information:

- this doc directory
- ../contrib, which contains some more information about specific problems
- http://www-internal.alphanet.ch/~schaefer/vgetty/
- the mgetty mailing-list: mgetty-request@greenie.muc.de
- the mgetty/vgetty FAQ at
        HTML: <URL:http://www.webforum.de/FAQ.html>
        or as tar file: <URL:http://www.webforum.de/FAQ.html.tgz>
        SGML (Linuxdoc): <URL:http://www.webforum.de/FAQ.sgml>
