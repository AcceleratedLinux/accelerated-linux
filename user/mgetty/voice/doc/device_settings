voice-device-setting

This settings selects the device which should be used inside the modem
for voice-IO (phone-line, speaker, microphone,... )

This setting is done for vm with the commandline option -d,
and inside vgetty with the function 
int voice_set_device(int device)

The following devices are defined for vm/vgetty:

NO_DEVICE/1:		The modem goes on-hook.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=0"
			Rockwell: Not available, but mapped for many modem to
			DIALUP_LINE

DIALUP_LINE/2:		The modem selects the phone-line as IO-path
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=1" the modem goes off-hook!
			Rockwell: "AT'VLS=0" the modem needs an additionally
			"ATA" for going off-hook!

EXTERNAL_MICROPHONE/3:	The modem selects the external microphone for input.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=11"

INTERNAL_MICROPHONE/4:	The modem selects the internal microphone for input.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=6"
			Rockwell: "AT#VLS=3"

EXTERNAL_SPEAKER/5:	The external modem speaker is selected for output.
			IS101/V253modem: "AT+VLS=8"

INTERNAL_SPEAKER/6:	The internal modem speaker is selected for output.
			For many modems the speaker is only avaiable in
			connection with the phone-line.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=4"
			Rockwell: "AT#VLS=2"


LOCAL_HANDSET/7:	The modem selects the local phone as IO-path
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=2"
			Rockwell: "AT'VLS=1"

DIALUP_WITH_EXT_SPEAKER/8:
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=9"

DIALUP_WITH_INT_SPEAKER/9:
			The modem selects the speaker and the phone-line
			for IO.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=5"
			Rockwell: "AT#VLS=4


DIALUP_WITH_LOCAL_HANDSET/10:
			The modem can listen to connections between the
			local phone and a far station.
			%Hochohmigmithoeren
			When the modem detects a data/faxcalling-tone
			vgetty/vm can switch (someday) to data/fax ->
			mgetty sends ATA to the modem -> the modem goes
			off-hook which disconnects the local-phone from
			the phone-line, and a connection could be established
			between the local modem and the far station.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=3"
			Rockwell: (ugly) "AT#VLS=5" then "AT#VLS=8"
			Notes:
			1. Playing voice wouldn't work in this state.
			2. Some modems may return "ERROR" if the local-phone
			is on-hook. (No problem since the ERROR is catched
			by vgetty).
			3. Implementation of the above could also requiere
			changes to the <DLE><H>/<h> handling!

DIALUP_WITH_EXTERNAL_MIC_AND_SPEAKER/11:
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=13"

DIALUP_WITH_INTERNAL_MIC_AND_SPEAKER/12:
			Phone-line, internal microphne and internal speaker
			for IO.
			IS101/V253: "AT+VLS=7"
			Rockwell: "AT#VLS=5"
