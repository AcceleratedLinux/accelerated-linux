Hi all,

this is a new vgetty beta release. It is also the last vgetty release from
me. As probably everybody already noticed, my free time does not allow me to
take proper care of vgetty anymore. So I decided to pass this project on to

  Marc Schaefer <schaefer@alphanet.ch>

to take care of vgetty in the future. I wish you good luck Marc! And I
promise to continue to help you with the code as much as I can. I will not
disappear completely, don't be afraid of that. I will try to follow the
future development of vgetty as close as possible. And of course: Please
everybody, support Marc as good as you supported me with bug reports,
patches, ideas, anything... Thanks!

If you plan to submit buxfixes or changes, please mail them to Marc
Schaefer from now on.

The new release is included in the latest mgetty-beta on alpha.greenie.net
as always. See http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty for details.

Enjoy,
Marc
