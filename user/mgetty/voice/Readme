  Hints
 -------

The number of bug reports has drastically decreased, so either all people
gave up or there are not so many bugs left. For those, who start with
vgetty, please read the file doc/Readme.Beginners very careful. If you mail
me a question, that is answered there, in the mgetty FAQ or the mgetty
mailing list archive, I'm probably not going to answer your mail. This is
not ment personally against you, it's just my limited time. I apologize for
not being able to provide a better support.

If you have problems with playing or recording messages with your local
telephone, you might be interested in the ZyXEL switch box. This box is
useful for modems, that do not provide power for a telephone connected to
the modem. With this switch box you can record and play messages with your
local telephone. To record and play messages, use vm with the -t option to
tell the modem to use the telco line.

If you have problems, feel free to write me a mail. I'm always very busy, so
it might take a while until you receive a reply from me. If you don't get
one within 14 days, something went wrong and you should try again.

If you want to mail me a bug fix or a new feature, you added to vgetty,
please mail me a unified diff of your changes. Everything else is more work
for me and since I don't have the time, I will probably never add your
changes. To produce such a diff, copy the original file from the
distribution to file.c.orig, then modify file.c and test it out and then use
the command "diff -u file.c.orig file.c > patch_for_marc" and mail me the
diff file "patch_for_marc". The option -u is important, because otherwise
you procude a different kind of diff. I apologize for this, but my time only
permits me to accept unified diffs. This is, because I'm never adding new
code directly to the sources, I'm always reading your changes and then I
decide, whether I will include them or not. Thanks for your help!
