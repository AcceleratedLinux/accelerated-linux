Marc,

  I have CC: Gert just on the off chance he is interested.

  Should have all you need to put your voice mail up on a web page.
  Protection and user authentication is handled by the httpd.
  I am debating adding in the ability to create folders, and move
  vmails into them.  Currently, only one folder 'Archive' is
  implemented.

  Opinion?

  I will have to create an install document I suppose... but all you need
  should be there.

  Feel free to do whatever you want with this.  Out of curiosity, how
  significant of an addition/effort does one have to contribute to get
  listed in the THANKS/contributors file?

  I think I may add in fax manipulation later this weekend if I dont drink
  too much beer.  I am also debating doing the rmftowav conversion at message
  play time, and using "content type" to play the file.  This would likely
  decrease the storage size of the messages

  On a side note, I notice that some times vgetty doesn't notice the person
  has hung up, and keeps recording.  Any chance I could get you to peek at
  my policy.h and voice.conf (available off of same web page) and see if
  any explanation jumps out at you?

  On the point I mentioned earlier about having a hangup script to be called
  whenever a call has come in (and caller id info is available) but
  disconnected prior to leaving a message, fax, or data.  I think that
  would be valuable.  It would let you know that say your boss has
  phoned 17 times for you, and not left a message, or help you identify
  the phone number of a creepy person who calls and hangs up repeatedly.
  If this were implemented, I would incorporate it into this vm.cgi program.

  I am still amazed at the ease with which vgetty was setup (after I set
  the modem registers up right).  It might be a good idea to encourage
  someone to compile modem profiles for different modem's where vgetty
  has been successfully installed.  This might speed up instalation,
  and reduce prolems/questions on the mailing list.  If none volunteer, I
  could post on the list, and then compile a list.

Cheers,

Roger
