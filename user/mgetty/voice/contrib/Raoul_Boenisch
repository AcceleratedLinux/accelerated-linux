Hi,

I'm so sorry for not mailing such a long time. I tried to find out about
my problem, but failed so long. Now I found out it's the port_speed which
I have to set to 38400. I used to set it to 115200, and this only works
with mgetty-1.1.10's vgetty, not with the 1.1.13, 1.1.14, 1.1.20 and
1.1.21 releases. I don't know why, but it's even documented for
mgetty-1.1.10's vgetty (in the /etc/mgetty+sendfax/voice.conf comments),
that Rockwell modems need 38400. This Dr. Neuhaus Smarty seems to be like
those Rockwell modems though it is Dr. Neuhaus Cybermod compatible.

The port_speed 38400 make my modem pick up the line again. But then
another problem occurred: the vgettys of mgetty-1.1.13 and later didn't
play the greeting messages. It took only a bit time to recognize it's a
problem with output volume.

The greeting message is actually played which I could test by using a very
long message. With volume commands AT+VGT=x where x is 134, 133 or 132 the
message volume seems to be zero. With an x of 131 (80%) it works (tested
with mgetty-1.1.21 only). I haven't tested any other x values yet as I
would first like to have an idea how to test it more efficiently than
manipulating the voice.conf's percentage. But it's not very important
anyway as I think, because it seems to be a problem with my modem! The log
files are ok, and I think vgetty sends the correct commands. So there does
not seems to be any vgetty bug causing this. I have to stress that the
manual of my modems says VGT values from 122 to 134 are valid. Even the
online help says so:

at+vgt=?
(122-134)

OK

Perhaps you have an idea what the problem could be and especially why I
can't use port_speeds other than 38400 with this Dr. Neuhaus Smarty.

So long

	Raoul
