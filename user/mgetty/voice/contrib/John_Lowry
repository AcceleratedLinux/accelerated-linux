If I have understood your question correctly, you want to tell the modem 
to ignore the initial beeps. Here is what I used to make my USR modem 
wait 4 seconds before the dial tone starts (to overcome the stutter voice 
mail message I get):

I added the following to US_Robotics.c::USR_init, to deal with my
PacBell voice mail system:

     /*
      * Fix put in by jlowry to ignore stutter dial tone
      * Can either set S6=4 to make modem wait 4 secs for dial tone
      * or enable blind dial (usually X0 or X1)
      */
     if (voice_command("ATS6=4", "OK") != VMA_USER_1)
          lprintf(L_WARN, "can't ignore stutter dial tone");


Hope this helps.
