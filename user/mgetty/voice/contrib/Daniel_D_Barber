I posted earlier about a package I created which answers the phone and
will send the caller to a personalized greeting (or disconnect). 
Included in this package is:

A script which will check who called that day
A script which will compile a phone listing of the people who have
called you
A script which will view the phone listing
A script which will allow you to listen to and remove voicemail.

This package is available for download from: 
http://www.shutter.net/~dbarber

These are very simple scripts. Written by a non-programmer.  If you like
the package and would like to suggest some improvements, add something
to it, write a gui for it, etc. please let me 
know.  I can incorporate the additions and changes into the next
release.

I welcome anyone who can help me make this into a viable, simple, and
fully functioning package -- whether by adding to it, helping to debug,
or writing better documentation.

What I like about these scripts are it's out-of-the-box functionality. 
You put them in the correct directories, edit for your system, and 
voila!, it's working.  

I hope this aids in making mgetty/vgetty more open to the linux user
community.

thanks alot,

Dan Barber
