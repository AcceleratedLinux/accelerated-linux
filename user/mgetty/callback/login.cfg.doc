Set up login.config like this:

------- login.config sample, file version 2 ----------
# login.config
#
# use version-2 format
!version 2
#
#
# this is the dummy user name, it's allowed to login only if this 
# is not already an ongoing callback
callback	N	-	-	/bin/login @
#
# these are the real users: only allowed if it's a callback ("Y")
*		Y	-	- 	/bin/login @
#
# if some other user name was entered, and it's not a callback, 
# throw them out
*		-	-	-	/bin/false
------- login.config sample, file version 2 ----------

I admit that the "version 2" stuff isn't documented anywhere yet (except
the source) and it hasn't been fully tested either.  So please get mgetty
1.1.20, test it, and report back to us :)
