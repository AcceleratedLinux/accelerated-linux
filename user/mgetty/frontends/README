Most of the stuff in here wasn't written by me, so please ask
your questions to the corresponding authors, not me!

The stuff in here is roughly ordered like this:

tkperl/	Klaus Lichtenwalder's fax manager, needs tkperl
tcl/	Ralf Schleicher's faxview.tcl script, needs tcl/tk
cli/	Some small command line faxing tools by me (rough samples)
X11/	Frank D. Cringle's g3view tool
	Michael Staats' xforms tool (just a pointer)
dialog/	Small shell/dialog script for viewing incoming and outgoing fax
	queues (faxv, xfaxq) and playing incoming voice messages (listen)
mmdf-mail2fax/ sample implementation of a mail to fax gateway (MMDF, SCO Unix)
mail2fax/ yet another mail to fax gateway implementation
faxmail/  and yet *another* mail to fax gateway :-)
