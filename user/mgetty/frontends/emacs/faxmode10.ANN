Subject: ANNOUNCE: Fax mode for GNU Emacs
Status: RO

Hi,

I've submitted my Fax mode for GNU Emacs to the elisp-archive on
`cis.ohio-state.edu' today (size of `fax-mode.tar.gz' is 47 kB).

;; LCD Archive Entry:
;; fax-mode|Ralph Schleicher|rs@purple.IN-Ulm.DE|
;; Fax sending commands for GNU Emacs.|
;; 16-Dec-95|1.0|~/modes/fax-mode.tar.gz|

Setting up a fax to be sent is very much like composing an e-mail except
that you have to say `M-x fax'.  You can also send any part of an Emacs
buffer directly by simply typing `M-x sendfax-region'.

Fax mode supports virtually every fax sub-system.  The most important
ones, `HylaFAX' by Sam Leffler <sam@sgi.com> and the `mgetty+sendfax'
package by Gert Doering <gert@greenie.muc.de>, are garantied to work.
