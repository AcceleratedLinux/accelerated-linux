TCL/TK frontend toolkits

faxview is Ralf Schleicher's Tcl/Tk frontend, you can find it in faxview-0.2/.

There exists another frontend, called PalMail, by Tim Bandelow. You can
find it in ftp://ftp.elilabs.com/pub/mgetty/PalMail-0.98.tgz. At the same
place, you can also find a linux binary.

[PalMail isn't maintained by Tim anymore, because he has no time.  But as
it's free under the GPL, feel free to take over maintenance...!]
