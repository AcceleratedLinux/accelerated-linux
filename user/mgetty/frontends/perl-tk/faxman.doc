Faxmanager                        (C) Copyright Klaus Lichtenwalder, 1995


What you can do with it:
The Faxmanager displays the list of incoming and outgoing faxes. The
incoming faxes are sorted newest on top, the outgoing faxes on
modification of their top-level directory, newest ones on top.

The received faxes list shows date and time of arrival, size, fax id
(if any), receiving devices and page number. There is a mechanism to
translate the fax id of the sender to a clear text message. You can
have a global alias table and a user-specific. The format is

	fax-sender-id (tabs or spaces) Alias

(Alias may contain spaces). The name of the system wide alias table is
/usr/local/lib/fax-aliases, the per-user alias table is
$HOME/.rec_fax_alias. If a fax-id (spelling by mgetty) matches the
alias, this alias is copied into the list.

The send fax list contains the state (suspended, active, done),
receiving fax number, the verbose_to in parentheses, the user id, the
number of pages, the earliest possible sending time (if any) and the
last line of the status sendfax returns.

The global commands are view, print and delete. 

Commands for the received faxes are save, which lets you move or copy a fax
into another directory. You must have read(/write) permission out of the
received fax directory (and for the destination too, of course).

The send fax list allows you to switch state from sent or suspended to
active or from active to suspended.
With change number you may change the addressee's fax number.
Change time let's you change/add/delete the sending time.

And then there's still the Quit command.

Implementation Details:

Interface language can be either German or English. You can set this
by changing the Variable $DEUTSCH to 1 for German and 0 for English.

The location of incoming faxes is the default location
/usr/spool/fax/incoming, the outgoing faxes are located in
/usr/spool/fax/outgoing, in the default F<##>.###/ hierarchy.

Every 5 minutes the outgoing dir is reread to check for new faxes and
to catch the possibly changed state of the other faxes (sent or
suspended). 

Options

The incoming dir gets stat-ed every minute to check for new faxes. If
the directory has changed M-TIME, a fax notifier gets popped up (wrongly
so if you removed a fax, but who cares :) to advertise for the new
fax(es). If you don't want this behaviour, use the
	-A
option.

-l force long listing
-s force short listing
-E don't export selected entries to the SELECTION.
