These programs need the Perl/Tk extentions to Perl 5.00x (5.004 or 5.005)

Warning: there are *two* Tk extention packages to Perl5. Do *NOT* use the
"tkperl5a5" written by Malcolm Beattie, it's outdated and not maintained
any more.

Get Perl/Tk written by Nick Ing-Simmons, available from your nearest
CPAN archive in $CPAN/authors/id/NI-S/Tk800.*.tar.gz.  (See www.perl.org
for a list of CPAN servers).


Warning2: right now, this is "under construction", nothing will work :(


Description:

  * faxman.pl : a very nice fax queue manager by Klaus Lichtenwalder,
		manages both input and output queues, printing, viewing,
		requeueing, ... -- try it!

  * xfax.pl   : a better-looking frontend to "faxspool", by me
