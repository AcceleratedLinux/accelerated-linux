Short desription of the workings:

On the Unix side, a program constantly checks for the arival of two
files in a designated directory. The lock file, called lck.###, and
the faxpages, called temp###.fax. In our naming scheme, the PCs are
simply given numbers from pc1 to pcn for identification purposes, as,
e.g., mailing the outcome of the fax sending.

On the pc, sending a word document is done by calling a macro that
asks for the faxnumber and the recipients name. The document gets
printed as PostScript file on the file system of the server (the
Postscript printer driver gets installed by the macros and this will
be undone after handing off the faxpage, at the moment a HP
LaserJet). After printing, the lock file gets written and the macro is
done.
