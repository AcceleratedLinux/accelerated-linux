This directory contains viewfax, a tool for displaying fax files
in an X Window.

Viewfax can display raw, digifax or tiff files containing g3 (T.4)
and/or g4 (T.6) coded fax pages.

To install viewfax you need an ansi C compiler on a machine
supporting X11.  No toolkit is required, just Xlib.

If you have a correctly installed imake, type:

    xmkmf
    make depend
    make
    make install
    make install.man

If you do not want to use imake you will need to adjust the Makefile
for your environment.
