Version 2.3 released
--------------------

Sun Oct 15 11:23:01 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* viewfax.c (drawline): interpret LineNum parameter within strip.
	(GetImage): iterate over strips of multistrip image.

	* faxinput.c (notetiff): grab whole directory into memory.  Don't
	treat non-fax tiffs as raw files.  Put strip info in an array
	rather than a linked list.  Accept compression mode 2 (MH).

	   (I chickened out of actually processing them).
	(expand2d): correct bug in EOL handling.
	(MHexpand): new routine.
	(g31expand, g32expand, g4expand): loop limit is rowsperstrip, mot
	height.
	(g4expand): semi-fix RTC detection (still does not allow for
	padding).

Sat Oct 14 11:27:03 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* viewfax.man: faxview.tcl was viewfax.tcl (got hit by a global
	replace).  Added Shift-Q, L, M, U keys.

	* Imakefile: add definition for MANDIR.  The helpfile is nonexec.
	Don't define local directories if freebsd.

	* viewfax.c (ShowLoop): New keypress meanings:
	Shift-Q - terminate with prejudice (requested by Ralph Schleicher).
	Shift-L,M,U - rotate this and all following pages (requested by
	Viet Hoang).

--------------------
Version 2.2 released
--------------------

Mon Sep 11 10:21:17 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* viewfax.c (GetImage): this routine must return a status
	indicating if getpage() failed.  Its callers must try again until
	it succeeds (to deal with missing pages).

Sun Sep 10 17:31:39 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* viewfax.man: update to reflect new functionality.

	* viewfax.c (main): TIFF is no longer optional (the help page is a
	tiff file).
	(ShowLoop): display help page if requested.  Accept BackSpace key
	for previous page.  Mirror image if requested.
	(ZoomImage): the pb1 pointer could overrun the end of the Big
	image by one word if an odd number of Big words fit in a Small
	line.
	(MirrorImage): new routine.

	* faxexpand.h: keep a list of strip offsets in pagenodes instead
	of a single offset to the fax data in a file.  Add the
	mirror-image orientation flag.  Remove WITH_TIFF.

	* faxinput.c (notetiff): handle all 8 orientations.  Handle
        multi-strip tiff images.  Remove WITH_TIFF.

	* faxexpand.c (SKIP_EOL): don't set a0 = lastx after an error, it
	is a lie that prevents the line being properly filled out.
	(g31expand & g32expand): report incorrect line length if verbose.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): remove -DWITH_TIFF - it is no longer
	optional.  Add g3hack and the HELPFILE.  Add -ansi -pedantic to
	gcc flags.

	* Imakefile: remove WITH_TIFF, add HELPFILE.

	* README: make / make depend in wrong order.  Remove comment about
	WITH_TIFF.

Wed Jun 21 09:44:25 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Updated the FSF address in all file headers.

--------------------
Version 2.1 released
--------------------

Wed Apr 12 11:24:34 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* faxexpand.c: simpified access to raw data by preprocessing it
	into 16-bit lsb-first chunks.  Ensure all macros are either
	expressions or statements (not blocks).

	* faxinit.c: build tables for access with lsb-first bit order.

	* faxinput.c: new source file containing routines moved from
	viewfax.c.

	* viewfax.c: moved the input file processing to a separate source
	file (faxinput.c) in preparation for use with other utilities.
	Eliminated G3desc and made the expansion routines use pagenodes.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed again due to name conflict with hylafax/contrib/faxview.
Now call viewfax.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Apr  7 18:10:35 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 2.0 released.

	* faxexpand.c: new expansion routines g32expand() and g4expand().
	Caller provides a pointer to the line drawing routine for future
	flexibility.

	* faxview.c (main): new options -2 and -4.
	(drawline): moved out of faxexpand.c.

	* README: Mention g4, WITH_TIFF.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed from g3view to faxview to reflect new functionality.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Apr  1 21:06:55 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 1.9 released to testers.

	* g3view.man: mention tiff and hylafax.  Document new keys for
	previous/next page.

	* g3view.c (notetiff): new function which figures out where the
	raw image data is in a tiff file.

Fri Mar 31 12:17:53 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* g3view.c (usleep): added to the list of systems which have
	usleep in libc.
	(SetupDisplay): restrict the initial window size to the physical
	screen size even if the virtual root is bigger.
	(ShowLoop): allow '-' as a synonym for previous page and '+' and
	space as synonyms for next page.

Sun Feb 26 15:31:53 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 1.8 released.

	* g3view.c (getpage): report memused (in verbose mode) after
	generating the new image.
	(SetupDisplay): fixed problems with negative geometry coordinates.
	(ShowLoop): improved the handling of user window-movement and
	resizing.  Maintain image position when it is zoomed in a
	constrained window size.

Thu Feb 16 12:18:38 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* g3view.c: #define XLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS is required by SCO- (and
	maybe other) systems in order to access the contents of the
	Display structure.
	(RotImage): fixed boundary problem.
	(main): allow any abbreviation of -display and -geometry.
	(ShowLoop): process all pending key- and button-presses before
	updating display.  Ignore key and button presses while the window
	is changing size, otherwise the image size and window size can get
	out of sync.
	(ShowLoop): don't jump to the top left if -geometry constrains
	size but not position.

Wed Feb 15 13:21:36 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* g3expand.c (G3init): finally killed the gentab -> g3tables
	precomputing step, in favour of run-time initialisation.  Time for
	G3init is down in the profiling noise.

	* g3view.c (SetupDisplay): use the size of the root window rather
	than the size of the screen as the maximum possible geometry.
	(ShowLoop): use the user-specified geometry (default: entire root
	window) to constrain the area available to g3view.

	* g3view.man: get rid of -x and talk about window managers.

Tue Feb 14 20:55:57 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* g3view.c (ShowLoop): another change to the window resizing
	logic.  It now works as desired with all window managers except
	fvwm.  Use g3view -x25 under fvwm until fvwm gets fixed.

	* g3view.man: documented -r and -x

Sun Feb 12 18:45:28 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* g3view.c: added command-line-settable display and geometry
	values, dynamic bit-reversal of input files and warning bell
	(audible/visible) when attempting to move to non-existent page.
	Removed -m and -x window-manager kludges.  -m now gives limit to
	image-memory cache size.
	(getpage): delete the mmap() version.  We now always suck the
	input file into memory so we can optionally bit-reverse it and so
	we can add zeros at the end to prevent the expansion algorithm
	over-running without having to check each byte.  Also survive
	unreadable or empty files by removing them from the file list.
	(GetVRoot): took this function from the comp.windows.x FAQ.  I
	can't test it 'cos I don't have the solbourne virtual WM around
	here.
	(SetupDisplay): process user's geometry spec.
	(ShowLoop): try to cooperate with the window manager by tracking
	Reparent and Configure events.  Use NewImage() and FreeImage() to
	manage cache size.  Give warning when there is no previous/next
	page.  Allow zooming with z/Z.
	(RotImage): provide faster version which does 4 rows at a time.

	* g3expand.c: removed the compile-time REVERSE option (we now have
	an equivalent at run-time). Removed 2D states from debug list.
	(G3expand): Added line number to error messages.  Tightened up
	end-of-data detection to prevent core dumps.
	(G3count): Continue counting after spurious EOLs (for
	efax-mutilated digifax files).

	* g3.h: removed unused 2D state definitions.

	* README: recommend Imakefile.

	* Makefile: $(HAVE) is no longer needed.  Added -Wno-uninitialized
	to suppress uninteresting warnings in new RotImage() code.  Added
	Imakefile to FILES.

	* g3view.man: renamed from g3view.1 to comply with Imake
	convention.  Added documentation of new features.

Mon Feb  6 12:42:14 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Makefile: don't need _HAVE_XSETWMPROTOCOLS any more.

	* g3view.c: added -m and -x flags.  Avoid using SetWMProtocols for
	compatibility with ancient installations.  Release non-essential
	memory and retry if a malloc or Xcall fails.

	* g3view.1: documented -m and -x flags.

Sat Feb  4 12:43:50 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* g3expand.c (G3expand): fixed a malloc bug (not enough memory
	requested for run-length list).

Fri Feb  3 11:10:48 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* g3view.c: Support a list of files on the command line rather
	than just a single page.

	* g3view.1: Updated to reflect new functionality.

	* g3view.c (ZoomImage): still didn't work on little-endian
	hosts. It now operates on 32 bit words and should be
	architecture-independent (and faster).  Three versions are
	available via #ifdef.
	(SetupDisplay): it is unnecessary to constrain the minimum window
	size.
	(ShowLoop): changed the image scrolling method (middle mouse
	button) to actively chew through the event queue instead of
	waiting for motion hints.  The old method is still available if
	USE_MOTIONHINT is defined.
	(SetupDisplay): fix a rounding problem with the initial window
	size.

Thu Feb  2 23:00:00 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Makefile: tar and shar targets added.

	* g3view.1: update to reflect changed middle button handling.

	* g3view.c: added version number and "COPYING" reference to usage
	and verbose messages.  Removed arguments from getopt() prototype
	(there is no consensus about if, where and how it is declared).
	Fixed problem with window size constraints when running under mwm.
	(ZoomImage): corrected packing order on little-endian hosts.
	(ShowLoop): improved middle button handling (now it drags the
	image rather than making it jump).
	

Tue Jan 31 18:00:00 1995  Frank D. Cringle  <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.
