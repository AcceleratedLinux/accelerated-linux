These are two packages with macros for Microsoft Winword, to enable
faxing from withing Word. You will be asked for a fax number, and then
the macro will print to a network printer. A backend on the unix side
will pull the fax number out of the print job, and send it to "faxspool".

Please look into the packages for more detailed instructions.

A third package written by Klaus Lichtenwalder can be found in ../winword2.
