# Subject: Re: Yet another way to handle incoming fax
# Status: RO
#
# After reading the articles in this thread I decided to change my new_fax
# script. The following script combines all received pages to one
# tiff-file which is sent to all recipients beeing in the alias for fax.
# Reading the fax is quite easy with Netscape when the tiffsurf-plugin is
# installed.
#
# As the script may be usefull for someone I'll post it here. It's quite
# short (and perhaps not that elegant...), but for me it works great.
#
# Bye,
# Markus.
