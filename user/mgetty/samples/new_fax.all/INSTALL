Step 1: Extract the archive
Step 2: Read the README file
Step 3: Find out where mgetty exprects new_fax
Step 4: Create a symbolic link to new_fax 
Step 5: Check the config lines inside of new_fax
Step 6: Edit the faxlist file
Step 7: Test it!

To find where mgetty expects new_fax, enter

	strings /usr/sbin/mgetty | grep new_fax

To test new_fax enter a command like

	/usr/local/sbin/new_fax 0 12345 1 /var/spool/fax/incoming/fnXXX.01

This would simulate a sucessfull fax from 12345. You should take an existing
file inside /var/spool/fax/incoming.
