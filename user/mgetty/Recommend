MODEM Recommendations for use with mgetty/vgetty
------------------------------------------------

What modem to recommend depends on your needs.  There are very few modems
that handle fax + data + voice perfectly, but quite a number that are
well suited for two of the categories, and less good (or sometimes not
at all) for the third.

For Fax+Data:  
    * USR Courier V.34/X.2 (no voice)

For FAX+Voice: 
    * ZyXEL 1496 (data only up to 19200, but best fax implementation)

For Data+Voice:
    * USR Sportster VI series (fax implementation is VERY bad)
 
For FAX+DATA+Voice
    * ZyXEL 2864
    * MultiTech MT2834ZDXv [watch out - recent firmware versions are weird,
      I have been told that 0316D firmware is OK, but make sure that you
      can return the modem if it doesn't work]
    * ELSA MicroLink TQV/Office series (fax is not perfect, but works ok)
