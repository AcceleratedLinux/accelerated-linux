This is a collection of useful tools, to be documented one day..

- kvg   : kill a running mgetty process with a specified signal, as in:
	  "kvg -1 ttyS0"

- ltest : display state of the serial port control lines (DCD, DTR, DSR,
          RTS, CTS) on systems that support querying them.  Optionally,
	  you can also set the RTS and DTR lines interactively.

	  Run like this: "ltest /dev/ttyS0" or "ltest -k /dev/ttyS0"

	  To see line changes in quasi real time, run like this:

	    "ltest -m 50 -d /dev/ttyS0"

	  this will check all 50 msec ("-m 50") for changes ("deltas", -d)
	  in the modem status lines, and print the new values.

	    
- mid   : "modem identify"

	  Run like this: "mid /dev/ttyS0" to see what sort of modem is there
	  (or whether there is something responding at all).  Don't be 
	  surprised if some of the AT commands used for querying cause
	  ERROR messages - not all commands are available everywhere

- microcom : like minicom, but "bare minimum needed to talk to a modem"

	  Run like this: "microcom /dev/ttyS0", exit with ctrl-x
