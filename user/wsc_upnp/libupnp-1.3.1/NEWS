What is new in libupnp 1.3.1

* fix: "upnp.h" includes "upnpdebug.h" only if debug enabled in the library 
  (else header file is not installed)

* fix: add inter-library dependencies between upnp and ixml / threadutil, 
  so that programs linking against upnp only still work.

============================================================================

What is new in libupnp 1.3.0

* major change: autoconfiscate build system. automake + autoconf replace the 
  previous makefiles. This should allow for easier build and installation on
  various distributions.

* change: optional library features are selected with configure options 
  (such as "./configure --enable-debug --disable-device") : see README file
  for the main options, and "./configure --help" to display a complete list.

* new: install a pkgconfig file "libupnp.pc"

* new: a new installed file <upnp/upnpconfig.h> provides macros to know
  the installed library version, and the optional features which have
  been configured in the library.

* change: the old included file "config.h", which contained internal 
  definitions needed to compile the library, is no longer installed in <upnp>

* change: the debug definitions previously available in <upnp/config.h>
  are now available in <upnp/upnpdebug.h> (only if library configured with 
  debug enabled).

* change: add libtool versionning for the 3 libraries. 
  Also hide all library symbols not part of the public API.

* change: remove "hard" limit to 32K in UpnpSetContentLength
  (not suitable for UPnP AV clients).

* new: new "UpnpSetMaxContentLength" function to globally set the maximum 
  incoming content-length that the SDK will process (should be used instead 
  of UpnpSetContentLength, which does not uses its handle argument)

* change: returns OUTOF_BOUNDS instead of BAD_HTTPMSG when exceed allowed
  Content Length

* new: ixml: new function ixmlRelaxParser to make the XML parser more tolerant
  to malformed text, if required (default behaviour is unchanged : abort 
  on error)

* fix: compilation error with gcc4

* fix: add some missing const's in public API

* fix: add check for availability of socklen_t type

* fix: miscellaneous bugs and warnings (see details in ChangeLog)
