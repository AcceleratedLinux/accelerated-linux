<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Linux SDK for UPnP Devices contains functions that generate 
asynchronous callbacks. To simplify the application callback functions, 
these callbacks are executed on a thread owned by the SDK itself.  The 
SDK executes the application's callback function in a thread 
context so the application can allocate memory and preserve the information
it needs. The application can also use standard thread synchronization 
methods to ensure data integrity.  Due to the possibility of deadlock, the 
application cannot call back into the SDK during these callbacks 
unless explicitly noted.  There is no restriction in calling into the 
operating system or any other application interfaces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
