<BLOCKQUOTE><B>UpnpUnSubscribeAsync</B> removes a subscription of a control
point from a service previously subscribed to using <B>
UpnpSubscribe</B> or <B>UpnpSubscribeAsync</B>, generating a callback
when the operation is complete.

<P>Note that many of the error codes for this function are returned in
the <B>Upnp_Event_Subscribe</B> structure.  In those cases, the function
returns <TT>UPNP_E_SUCCESS</TT> and the appropriate error code will
be in the <B>Upnp_Event_Subscribe.ErrCode</B> field in the <B>Event</B>
structure passed to the callback.
