<BLOCKQUOTE>The Linux DOM2 XML Parser Version 1.2 (IXML) is a lightweight, portable XML
parser supporting the standard Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 
interfaces. The parser uses a C-style interface, making it idea for small, 
embedded applications.  This document describes the interfaces supported by
IXML 1.2, referencing the W3C DOM2 recommendations when necessary, and the 
additional utility application programming interfaces (APIs) that it 
supports. 

<P>Note that this document assumes that the reader has a copy of the DOM2-Core
recommendation.  Refer to the link below to obtain a copy.  Only a brief
description is included here and the reader is pointed to the DOM2-Core
recommendation for more details.  This document does, however, clarify 
IXML-specific behavior when the recommendation is unclear.

<P><B>About DOM</B>

<P>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a set of interfaces that give a 
programmatic interface to documents.  It provides a platform-neutral and 
language-neutral interface for random access and updating elements inside 
XML documents.  DOM Level 1 provided the basic interfaces to access 
document elements.  DOM Level 2 extended the interfaces to provide proper 
support for XML namespaces.

<P>The latest DOM 2 recommendation is maintained by W3C and is available from 
<TT>http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core</TT>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
