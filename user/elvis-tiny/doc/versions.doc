E12.  VERSIONSF

        Elvis  currently  works  under BSD UNIX, AT&T System-V UNIX, SCO
     XENIX, Minix, Coherent, MS-DOS,  Atari  TOS,  and  OS9/68k.    This
     section  of the manual provides special information that applies to
     each particular version of Elvis.  

        For all versions except MS-DOS, the file  "Makefile.mix"  should
     be  copied to "Makefile", and then edited to select the correct set
     of options for your system.  There is more information  about  this
     embedded in the file itself.  


   E12.1  BSD UNIXF

        Temporary files are stored in /tmp.  

        Elvis doesn't  have  an  "expreserve" program yet.  Instead, you
     should modify /etc/rc so that the temp files are not  deleted  when
     the system is rebooted.  Find a line in /etc/rc which reads 

            rm -rf /tmp/*

        or something like that, and change it to read 

            rm -rf /tmp/[^e]* /tmp/e[^l]* /tmp/el[^v]* /tmp/elv_*

        If  you  do  not  have permission to modify /etc/rc, don't fret.
     The above modification is only needed to allow you to recover  your
     changes after a system crash.  You can still run Elvis without that 
     modification,  and  you  can  still recover your changes when Elvis
     crashes or when your dialup modem looses  the  carrier  signal,  or
     something like  that.   A system crash is the only thing that could
     hurt you.  

        Both Elvis and the real Vi read initialization commands  from  a
     file  called  ".exrc",  but the commands in that file might work on
     one but not the other.  For example, "set keywordprg=man" will work 
     for  Elvis,  but  Vi  will  complain  because  it  doesn't  have  a
     "keywordprg" option.    If the warning messages annoy you, then you
     can edit the config.h file to change the name of the initialization 
     file ".exrc" to something else, such as ".elvisrc".  

        If you use X windows, you  may  wish  to  add  "-DCS_LATIN1"  to
     CFLAGS.   This will cause the digraph table and the flipcase option
     to have  default  values  that  are  appropriate  for  the  LATIN-1
     character set.  That's the standard character set for X.  


   E12.2  System-V UNIXF

        If  your  system uses terminfo instead of termcap, then you will
     have to edit the LIBS setting in the Makefile.  Currently  it  says
     "LIBS=-ltermcap",    but   you   may   have   to   change   it   to
     "LIBS=-lterminfo" or "LIBS=-lterm" or something like that.  








     Elvis 1.4                    VERSIONS                     Page 12-2


        The /etc/rc  file  should  be  modified  as  described  for  BSD
     systems, above.  The potential trouble with ".exrc" described above 
     for BSD UNIX applies to System-V UNIX as well.  

        Elvis uses control-C as the interrupt key, not Delete.  


   E12.3  SCO XenixF

        For Xenix-386,  you  can use the generic System-V settings.  You
     may wish to add "-DCS_IBMPC" to CFLAGS, to have the  digraph  table
     and  flipcase option start up in a mode that is appropriate for the
     console.  
     There is a separate group of settings for use with Xenix-286.    It
     already has "-DCS_IBMPC" in CFLAGS.  

        Because  Xenix  is  so  similar  to  System-V, everything I said
     earlier about System-V applies to the Xenix version too.  


   E12.4  MinixF

        There are separate settings in  Makefile.mix  for  Minix-PC  and
     Minix-ST.   The  differences  between  these  two  are  that the ST
     version uses ".o" for  the  object  file  extension  where  the  PC
     version  uses  ".s",  and  the  PC  version has some extra flags in
     CFLAGS to reduce the size of Elvis.    The  PC  version  also  uses
     tinytcap (instead of the full termcap) to make it smaller.  

        Minix-PC  users  should  read  the CFLAGS section of this manual
     very carefully.  You have some choices to make...  

        The temporary files  are  stored  in  /usr/tmp.    The  /usr/tmp
     directory  must  exist  before  you  run  Elvis,  and  it  must  be
     readable/writable by everybody.  We use /usr/tmp  instead  of  /tmp
     because  after a system crash or power failure, you can recover the
     altered version of a file from the temporary file in /usr/tmp.   If
     it  was  stored in /tmp, though, then it would be lost because /tmp
     is probably located on the RAM disk.  

        Elvis uses control-C as the interrupt key, not Delete.  


   E12.5  CoherentF

        Elvis was ported to Coherent by Esa Ahola.  

        Elvis is too large to run under Coherent  unless  you  eliminate
     some features via the CFLAGS setting.  The recommended settings, in 
     Makefile.mix,  produce a working version of elvis which emulates Vi
     faithfully, but lacks most of the extensions.  You should read  the
     CFLAGS section of this manual carefully.  

        You  can  probably  reduce the size of Elvis by using tinytcap.c
     instead of -lterm.  This would allow you to keep most  features  of
     Elvis, at  the  expense  of terminal independence.  (Tinytcap.c has
     ANSI escape sequences hard-coded into it.) To  use  tinytcap,  just
     add  "tinytcap.o"  to the "EXTRA=" line in the Makefile, and remove





     Elvis 1.4                    VERSIONS                     Page 12-3


     "-lterm" from the "LIBS=" line.  

        The temporary files are stored in /tmp.  You should modify  your
     /etc/rc file as described for BSD earlier.  


   E12.6  MS-DOSF

        Elvis  was  ported to MS-DOS by Guntram Blohm and Martin Patzel.
     Dave  Lord  also  deserves  a  big  "thank  you"  for  exploring  a
     compatibility glitch between DOS 4.01 and Elvis.  

        Ideally,  Elvis  should be compiled with Microsoft C 5.1 and the
     standard Microsoft Make utility, via the command "make  elvis.mak".
     This will compile Elvis and all related utilities.  

        If  you  have  Turbo-C,  then you can 4almost5 use the "Elvis.prj"
     file to compile Elvis.    EYou  must  explicitly  force  Turbo-C  to
     compile  it  with  the "medium" memoryF Emodel, and you must increase
     the stack size to 16k.F Most of the related  programs  (ctags,  ref,
     virec, refont, and wildcard) are  only one file long, so you should 
     have no  trouble compiling them.  The "alias.c" file is meant to be
     compiled once into an executable named "ex.exe".  You  should  then
     copy "ex.exe" to "vi.exe", and "view.exe".  

        Elvis stores  its  temporary  files  in  C:\tmp.  If this is not
     satisfactory, then you should edit the CFLAGS line of your Makefile 
     to change TMPDIR to something else before compiling.  You can  also
     control  the name of the temp directory via an environment variable
     named TMP or TEMP.  The directory must exist  before  you  can  run
     Elvis.  

        Normally,  the  TERM  environment variable should not be set, or
     else it should be set to "pcbios".  This way, Elvis will make calls 
     to BIOS to update the screen.  (If you don't like the  colors  that
     the BIOS  interface  uses,  then  edit the attr[] table in pc.c.  A
     ":color" command will be added eventually.) 

        You may prefer to use  a  device  driver  such  as  ANSI.SYS  or
     NNANSI.SYS,  for  speed; or you may NEED to use a device driver for
     compatibility.  If so, you should install one of these  drivers  by
     adding  "driver  = ansi.sys" (or whatever) to your CONFIG.SYS file,
     and then you should define TERM to be either "ansi" or  "nansi"  by
     adding  a  line  such as "set TERM=ansi" to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
     You must then reboot for these changes to take effect.  After that, 
     Elvis will notice the "TERM" setting and use the driver.  

        Under MS-DOS, Elvis has an extra ":set" option  called  "pcbios"
     which indicates whether the BIOS is being used directly.  This is a 
     "read only" option; you can't use it to switch your interface style 
     in the middle of an edit session.  

        An extra  program,  called "wildcard", is needed for MS-DOS.  It
     expands wildcard characters in file names.

   E12.7  Atari TOSF

        Elvis was ported to  Atari  TOS  by  Guntram  Blohm  and  Martin
     Patzel.  It  is  very  similar  to the MS-DOS version.  It has only
     been tested with the Mark Williams C compiler.  

        The TERM environment variable is ignored;  the  ST  port  always
     assumes that  TERM=vt52.   The SHELL (not COMSPEC!) variable should
     be set to the name of a line-oriented shell.  

        A simple shell in  included  with  elvis.    Its  source  is  in
     "shell.c", and the name of the executable is "shell.ttp".  This was 
     necessary because the standard Atari software doesn't offer any way 
     to set environment variables.  The file "profile.sh" should contain 
     a  set  of  instructions to be executed when the shell first starts
     up.  An example of this file  is  included,  but  you  will  almost
     certainly want to edit it right away to match your configuration.  

        If  you  already have a command-line shell, then you'll probably
     want to continue using it.  The shell that comes with Elvis is very 
     limited.  

        Currently, character  attributes  cannot  be  displayed  on  the
     screen.   In  other  words, the "charattr" option doesn't work very
     well.  Its ironic -- the only system that always  has  a  bitmapped
     display is the only system that doesn't support multiple fonts!  


   E12.8  OS9/68kF

        Elvis was ported to OS9/68k by Peter Reinig.  

        The  Makefile  is  currently configured to install elvis and the
     related programs in /dd/usr/cmds If this this is unacceptable, then 
     you  should  change  the  BIN  setting  to  some  other  directory.
     Similarly,    it   expects   the   source   code   to   reside   in
     /dd/usr/src/elvis; the ODIR setting is used to control this.  

        Temporary files are stored  in  the  /dd/tmp  directory.    Your
     /dd/startup  file  may  need  to  be  modified  to  prevent it from
     deleting Elvis' temporary files.  

        The program in alias.c is linked repeatedly to produce the "vi", 
     "view", and "input" aliases for elvis.  Sadly, the  "ex"  alias  is
     impossible to implement under OS9, because the shell has a built-in 
     command by that name.  

        For  some  purposes,  you  must  give  `make'  the  "-b" option.
     Specifically, you need this  for  "make  -b  clean"  and  "make  -b
     install".
