E5.  OPTIONSF

        Options may be set or examined via the colon command "set".  The 
     values of options will affect the operation of later commands.  

        For convenience, options have both a long descriptive name and a 
     short name  which  is  easy  to  type.    You  may  use either name
     interchangably.  I like the short names, myself.

wrapscan        ws      Bool    ws              at EOF, searches wrap to line 1

        There are three types of options:  Bool,  string,  and  numeric.
     Boolean  options  are made TRUE by giving the name of the option as
     an argument to the "set" command; they are made FALSE by  prefixing
     the name  with  "no".    For  example,  "set  autoindent" makes the
     autoindent option TRUE, and "set noautoindent" makes it FALSE.  








     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-2


        To change the value of a string  or  numeric  option,  pass  the
     "set"  command  the name of the option, followed by an "=" sign and
     the option's new value.  For example, "set tabstop=8" will give the 
     tabstop option a value of 8.  For string options, you  may  enclose
     the new value in quotes.  


   E5.1  AutoIndentF

        During  input  mode, the autoindent option will cause each added
     line to begin with the same amount of  leading  whitespace  as  the
     line above  it.    Without  autoindent,  added  lines are initially
     empty.  


   E5.2  AutoPrintF

        This option only affects EX mode.  If the autoprint  option  on,
     and either the cursor has moved to a different line or the previous 
     command modified the file, then Elvis will print the current line.  


   E5.3  AutoWriteF

        When  you're  editing one file and decide to switch to another -
     via the :tag command, or :next command, perhaps - if  your  current
     file  has  been  modified,  then Elvis will normally print an error
     message and refuse to switch.  

        However, if the autowrite option is on, then  Elvis  will  write
     the modified version of the current file and successfully switch to 
     the new file.  


   E5.4  CCF

        The :cc  command runs the C compiler.  This option should be set
     to the name of your compiler.  


   E5.5  CharAttrF

        Many text formatting programs allow you to designate portions of 
     your text to be underlined, italicized, or  boldface  by  embedding
     the special  strings  \fU,  \fI, and \fB in your text.  The special
     string \fR marks the end of underlined or boldface text.  

        Elvis normally treats those special strings just like any  other
     text.  

        However, if the charattr option is on, then Elvis will interpret 
     those  special strings correctly, to display underlined or boldface
     text on the screen.  (This only works, of course, if your  terminal
     can  display underlined and boldface, and if the TERMCAP entry says
     how to do it.) 








     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-3


   E5.6  COlumnsF

        This is a "read only" option.  You can't change its  value,  but
     you can have Elvis print it.  It shows how wide your screen is.  


   E5.7  DIGraphF

        This  option  is used to enable/disable recognition of digraphs.
     The default value is nodigraph, which means that digraphs will  not
     be recognized.  


   E5.8  DIRectoryF

        Elvis stores text in temporary files.  This option allows you to 
     control which  directory those temporary files will appear in.  The
     default is /usr/tmp.  

        This option can only be set in a .exrc file; after  that,  elvis
     will  have  already  started  making  temporary files in some other
     directory, so it would be too late.  


   E5.9  EDcompatibleF

        This     option     affects     the     behaviour     of     the
     ":s/regexp/text/options" command.    It  is normally off (:se noed)
     which causes all of the  substitution  options  to  be  off  unless
     explicitly given.  

        However, with edcompatible on (:se ed), the substitution command 
     remembers which  options  you  used  last time.  Those same options
     will continue to be used until you change them.    In  edcompatible
     mode,  when  you explicitly give the name of a substitution option,
     you will toggle the state of that option.  

        This all seems very strange to me, but  its  implementation  was
     almost  free  when  I added the ":&" command to repeat the previous
     substitution, so there it is.  


   E5.10  ErrorBellsF

        Elvis normally rings a bell when you do something wrong.    This
     option lets you disable the bell.  


   E5.11  ExRefreshF

        The EX  mode  of Elvis writes many lines to the screen.  You can
     make Elvis either write each line to the screen separately, or save 
     up many lines and write them all at once.  

        The exrefresh option is normally on, so each line is written  to
     the screen separately.  







     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-4


        You  may wish to turn the exrefresh option off (:se noer) if the
     "write" system call is costly on your machine, or if you're using a 
     windowing environment.  (Windowing environments scroll text  a  lot
     faster when you write many lines at once.) 

        This option has no effect in visual command mode or input mode.  


   E5.12  FlipCaseF

        The  flipcase  option  allows  you  to control how the non-ASCII
     characters are altered by the "~" command.  

        The string is divided into pairs of characters.    When  "~"  is
     applied  to  a non-ASCII character, Elvis looks up the character in
     the flipcase string to see which pair it's in, and replaces  it  by
     the other character of the pair.  


   E5.13  HideFormatF

        Many  text  formatters  require  you to embed format commands in
     your text, on lines  that  start  with  a  "."  character.    Elvis
     normally  displays  these  lines  like  any  other text, but if the
     hideformat option is on, then format lines are displayed  as  blank
     lines.  


   E5.14  IgnoreCaseF

        Normally,  when  Elvis  searches  for  text, it treats uppercase
     letters as being different for lowercase letters.  

        When the ignorecase option is on, uppercase  and  lowercase  are
     treated as equal.  


   E5.15  InputModeF

        This  option  allows  you to have Elvis start up in insert mode.
     You can still exit insert mode at any time by hitting the ESC  key,
     as usual.  Usually, this option would be set in your ".exrc" file.  


   E5.16  KeyTimeF

        The   arrow  keys  of  most  terminals  send  a  multi-character
     sequence.  It takes a measurable amount of time for these sequences 
     to be transmitted.  The keytime option allows you  to  control  the
     maximum  amount  of time to allow for an arrow key (or other mapped
     key) to be received in full.  

        The default keytime value  is  2.    Because  of  the  way  UNIX
     timekeeping  works,  the  actual  amount  of time allowed will vary
     slightly, but it will always be between 1 and 2 seconds.  








     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-5


        If you set keytime to 1, then the actual amount of time  allowed
     will be  between  0  and  1  second.   This will generally make the
     keyboard's response be a little faster (mostly for  the  ESC  key),
     but  on those occasions where the time allowed happens to be closer
     to 0 than 1 second, Elvis may fail to  allow  enough  time  for  an
     arrow key's sequence to be received fully.  Ugh.  

        As a special case, you can set keytime to 0 to disable this time 
     limit stuff  altogether.    The  big problem here is: If your arrow
     keys' sequences start with an ESC, then every time you hit your ESC 
     key Elvis will wait...  and wait...  to see if maybe that  ESC  was
     part of an arrow key's sequence.  

        NOTE:  this  option is a generalization of the timeout option of
     the real vi.  


   E5.17  KeywordPrgF

        Elvis has a special keyword lookup feature.  You move the cursor 
     onto a word, and hit shift-K, and Elvis  uses  another  program  to
     look up the word and display information about it.  

        This option says which program gets run.  

        The  default  value  of this option is "ref", which is a program
     that looks up the definition of a function in C.  It looks  up  the
     function name in a file called "refs" which is created by ctags.  

        You  can subtitute other programs, such as an English dictionary
     program or the online manual.  Elvis runs the  program,  using  the
     keyword as its only argument.  The program should write information 
     to stdout.   The program's exit status should be 0, unless you want
     Elvis to print "<<< failed >>>".  


   E5.18  LiNesF

        This "read only" option shows how many lines you screen has.  


   E5.19  LIstF

        In nolist mode (the default), elvis displays text in a  "normal"
     manner  --  with  tabs expanded to an appropriate number of spaces,
     etc.  

        However, sometimes it is useful to have tab characters displayed 
     differently.  In list mode, tabs are displayed as "^I", and  a  "$"
     is displayed at the end of each line.  













     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-6


   E5.20  MAgicF

        The  search  mechanism in Elvis can accept "regular expressions"
     -- strings in which certain characters have special meaning.  

        The magic option is normally on, which causes  these  characters
     to be treated specially.  

        If you turn the magic option off (:se noma), then all characters 
     except ^ and $ are treated literally.  ^ and $ retain their special 
     meanings regardless of the setting of magic.  


   E5.21  MaKeF

        The :make command runs your "make" program.  This option defines 
     the name of your "make" program.  


   E5.22  ModeLineF

        Elvis supports   modelines.     Modelines  are  lines  near  the
     beginning or end of your text file which contain "ex:yowza:", where 
     "yowza" is any EX command.  A typical "yowza"  would  be  something
     like "set ts=4 ca kp=spell".  

        Normally  these  lines are ignored, for security reasons, but if
     you have  "set  modeline"  in  your  .exrc  file  then  "yowza"  is
     executed.  


   E5.23  PAragraphsF

        The  {  and  }  commands  move the cursor forward or backward in
     increments of one paragraph.  Paragraphs may be separated by  blank
     lines, or  by  a "dot" command of a text formatter.  Different text
     formatters use different "dot" commands.  This option allows you to 
     configure Elvis to work with your text formatter.  

        It is assumed that your formatter uses commands that start  with
     a  "."  character  at  the front of a line, and then have a one- or
     two-character command name.  

        The value of the paragraphs option is a  string  in  which  each
     pair  of  characters  is one possible form of your text formatter's
     paragraph command.  


   E5.24  ReadOnlyF

        Normally, Elvis will let you write back any file  to  which  you
     have write  permission.    If you don't have write permission, then
     you can only write the changed version of the file to  a  -1different-0
     file.  









     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-7


        If  you  set  the  readonly  option, then Elvis will pretend you
     don't have write permission to -1any-0 file you edit.    It  is  useful
     when  you  really  only mean to use Elvis to look at a file, not to
     change it.  This way you can't change it accidentally.  

        This option is normally off, unless you use the "view" alias  of
     Elvis.  "View" is like "vi" except that the readonly option is on.  


   E5.25  REportF

        Commands in  Elvis  may  affect  many  lines.  For commands that
     affect a lot of lines, Elvis will output a message saying what  was
     done and  how  many lines were affected.  This option allows you to
     define what "a lot of lines" means.   The  default  is  5,  so  any
     command  which  affects  5 or more lines will cause a message to be
     shown.  


   E5.26  SCrollF

        The ^U and ^D keys normally scroll backward or forward by half a 
     screenful, but this is adjustable.  The value of this  option  says
     how many lines those keys should scroll by.  


   E5.27  SEctionsF

        The  [[  and  ]] commands move the cursor backward or forward in
     increments of 1  section.    Sections  may  be  delimited  by  a  {
     character  in  column  1  (which is useful for C source code) or by
     means of a text formatter's "dot" commands.  

        This option allows you to configure Elvis to work with your text 
     formatter's "section" command, in exectly the  same  way  that  the
     paragraphs  option  makes it work with the formatter's "paragraphs"
     command.  


   E5.28  SHellF

        When Elvis forks  a  shell  (perhaps  for  the  :!    or  :shell
     commands) this  is  the  program  that is uses as a shell.  This is
     "/bin/sh" by default, unless you have set the  SHELL  (or  COMSPEC,
     for  MS-DOS)  environment variable, it which case the default value
     is copied from the environment.  


   E5.29  ShiftWidthF

        The < and > commands shift text left or right  by  some  uniform
     number of  columns.    The  shiftwidth option defines that "uniform
     number".  The default is 8.  










     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-8


   E5.30  ShowMatchF

        With showmatch set, in input mode every time you hit one of )}], 
     Elvis will momentarily move the cursor to the matching ({[.  


   E5.31  ShowMoDeF

        In visual mode, it is easy  to  forget  whether  you're  in  the
     visual command  mode or input/replace mode.  Normally, the showmode
     option is off, and you haven't a clue as to which mode  you're  in.
     If  you  turn the showmode option on, though, a little message will
     appear in the lower right-hand corner of your screen,  telling  you
     which mode you're in.  


   E5.32  SideScrollF

        For long lines, Elvis scrolls sideways.  (This is different from 
     the  real  vi,  which wraps a single long line onto several rows of
     the screen.) 

        To minimize the number of scrolls needed, Elvis moves the screen 
     sideways by several characters at a time.  The value of this option 
     says how many characters' widths to scroll at a time.  

        Generally, the faster your screen can be redrawn, the lower  the
     value you will want in this option.  


   E5.33  SYncF

        If  the system crashes during an edit session, then most of your
     work can be recovered from the temporary file that  elvis  uses  to
     store changes.   However, sometimes the OS will not copy changes to
     the hard disk immediately, so recovery might not be possible.   The
     [no]sync option lets you control this.  

        In  nosync mode (which is the default, for UNIX), elvis lets the
     operating system control when data is written to the disk.  This is 
     generally faster.  

        In sync mode (which is the default, for  MS-DOS),  elvis  forces
     all changes  out  to  disk  every  time you make a change.  This is
     generally safer, but slower.  It can also be a rather rude thing to 
     do on a multi-user system.  


   E5.34  TabStopF

        Tab characters are normally  8  characters  wide,  but  you  can
     change their widths by means of this option.  











     Elvis 1.4                     OPTIONS                      Page 5-9


   E5.35  TErmF

        This "read only" option shows the name of the termcap entry that 
     Elvis is using for your terminal.  


   E5.36  VBellF

        If your termcap entry describes a visible alternative to ringing 
     your terminal's bell, then this option will say whether the visible 
     version gets used or not.  Normally it will be.  

        If your termcap does NOT include a visible bell capability, then 
     the vbell option will be off, and you can't turn it on.  


   E5.37  WArnF

        If you have modified a file but not yet written it back to disk, 
     then Elvis will normally print a warning before executing a ":!cmd" 
     command.  However, in nowarn mode, this warning is not given.  

        Elvis  also  normally prints a message after a successful search
     that wrapped at EOF.  The [no]warn option  can  also  disable  this
     warning.  


   E5.38  WrapMarginF

        Normally   (with  wrapmargin=0)  Elvis  will  let  you  type  in
     extremely long lines, if you wish.  

        However,  with  warpmargin  set  to  something  other   that   0
     (wrapmargin=10  is nice), Elvis will automatically cause long lines
     to be "wrapped" on a word break for lines longer than  wrapmargin's
     setting.  


   E5.39  WrapScanF

        Normally,  when  you search for something, Elvis will find it no
     matter where it is in  the  file.    Elvis  starts  at  the  cursor
     position, and  searches forward.  If Elvis hits EOF without finding
     what you're looking for, then it wraps around to continue searching
