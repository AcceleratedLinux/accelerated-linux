E9.  CFLAGSF

        Elvis  uses  many  preprocessor  symbols to control compilation.
     Some of  these  control  the  sizes  of  buffers  and  such.    The
     "-DNO_XXXX" options remove small sets of related features.  

        Most  Elvis  users  will  probably  want  to  keep  all features
     available.  Minix-PC users, though, will  have  to  sacrifice  some
     sets because  otherwise  Elvis  would be too bulky to compile.  The
     "asld" phase of the compiler craps out.  

     -DM_SYSV, -DTOS, -DCOHERENT 
            These flags tell the compiler that Elvis is  being  compiled
            for  System-V  UNIX,  Atari  TOS, or Coherent, respectively.
            For other systems, the config.h file can generally figure it 
            out automatically.  

     -DDATE=4string5 
            DATE should be defined to be  a  string  constant.    It  is
            printed  by  the :version command as the compilation date of
            the program.  

            It is only used in cmd1.c, and even there you may  leave  it
            undefined without causing an urp.  

     -DNBUFS=4number5 
            Elvis  keeps  most  of your text in a temporary file; only a
            small amount is actually stored in RAM.   This  flag  allows
            you  to  control  how  much of the file can be in RAM at any
            time.  The default is 5 blocks.  (See  the  -DBLKSIZE  flag,
            below.) 

            More  RAM  allows  global changes to happen a little faster.
            If you're just making many small changes in one section of a 
            file, though, extra RAM won't help much.  

     -DBLKSIZE=4number5 
            This  controls  the  size  of   blocks   that   Elvis   uses
            internally.   The  value  of BLKSIZE must be a power of two.
            The default value is 1024, which allows you to edit files up 
            to almost 512K bytes long.  Every time you  double  BLKSIZE,
            you quadruple the size of a text file that Elvis can handle, 
            but you also cause the temporary file to grow faster.  

     -DTMPDIR=4string5 
            This sets the default value of the "directory" option, which 
            specifies where  the  temporary  files  should  reside.  The
            value of TMPDIR must be a string,  so  be  sure  your  value
            includes the quote characters on each end.  

     -DEXRC=4str5, -DHMEXRC=4str5, -DSYSEXRC=4str5, -DEXINIT=4str5 
            This  lets  you  control  the  names  of  the initialization
            files.  Their values must be strings, so  be  careful  about
            quoting.  









     Elvis 1.4                     CFLAGS                       Page 9-2


            EXRC  is  the name of the initialization file in the current
            directory.  Its default value is ".exrc" on UNIX systems  --
            the same  as  the  real  vi.    For other systems, check the
            config.h file.  

            HMEXRC is the name of the initialization file in  your  home
            directory.  By  default, it is the same as EXRC.  Elvis will
            automatically prepend the name of  your  home  directory  to
            HMEXRC at run time, so don't give a full path name.  

            SYSEXRC  is  the  name of a system-wide initialization file.
            It has no default value; if you don't define a value for it, 
            then the code that supports  SYSEXRC  just  isn't  compiled.
            The value of SYSEXRC should be a full pathname, in quotes.  

            EXINIT  is  the  name  of  an  environment variable that can
            contain initialization commands.   Normally,  its  value  is
            "EXINIT".  

     -DKEYWORDPRG=4string5 
            This  flag  determines the default value of the "keywordprg"
            option.  Its value must be a string,  so  be  careful  about
            quoting.   The default value of this flag is "ref", which is
            a C reference program.  

     -DCC_COMMAND=4string5 -DMAKE_COMMAND=4string5 -DERRLIST=4string5 
            These control the  names  of  the  C  compiler,  the  "make"
            utility, and  the error output file, respectively.  They are
            only used if -DNO_ERRLIST is not given.  

     -DMAXMAPS=4number5 
            This controls the capacity of the key map table.  

     -DMAXRCLEN=4number5 
            This determines how large a .exrc file can be  (measured  in
            bytes).  The  default  is  1000 bytes.  If you increase this
            value significantly, then you may  need  to  allocate  extra
            memory for  the  stack.    See  the  "CHMEM"  setting in the
            Makefile.  

     -DSHELL=4string5 
            This is the default value of the "shell" option,  and  hence
            the default  shell  used  from  within  Elvis.    This  only
            controls the  default;  the  value  you  give  here  may  be
            overridden  at  run-time  by setting an environment variable
            named SHELL (or COMSPEC for MS-DOS).  Its value  must  be  a
            string constant, so be careful about quoting.  

     -DTAGS=4string5 
            This  sets the name of the "tags" file, which is used by the
            :tag command.  Its value must be a string  constant,  so  be
            careful about quoting.  

     -DCS_IBMPC 
            The  digraph  table  and flipcase option will normally start
            out empty.  However, if you add -DCS_IBMPC or -DCS_LATIN1 to 
            your CFLAGS, then they will start  out  filled  with  values
            that are appropriate for the IBM PC character set or the ISO 





     Elvis 1.4                     CFLAGS                       Page 9-3


            Latin-1 character set, respectively.  

     -DDEBUG 
            This  adds  the  ":debug" and ":validate" commands, and also
            adds many internal consistency checks.    It  increases  the
            size of the ".text" segment by about 6K.  

     -DCRUNCH 
            This  flag  removes some non-critical code, so that Elvis is
            smaller.  For example,  it  removes  a  short-cut  from  the
            regexp package,  so  that  text  searches are slower.  Also,
            screen updates are not as efficient.  A  couple  of  obscure
            features are disabled by this, too.  

     -DNO_MKEXRC 
            This  removes  the  ":mkexrc" command, so you have to create
            any .exrc files manually.  The size  of  the  .text  segment
            will be reduced by about 600 bytes.  

     -DNO_CHARATTR 
            Permanently disables  the charattr option.  This reduces the
            size of your ".text" segment by about 850 bytes.  

     -DNO_RECYCLE 
            Normally, Elvis will recycle space (from the tmp file) which 
            contains totally obsolete text.   This  flag  disables  this
            recycling.   Without recycling, the ".text" segment is about
            1K smaller than it would otherwise  be,  but  the  tmp  file
            grows much  faster.  If you have a lot of free space on your
            harddisk, but Elvis is too bulky to run with recycling, then 
            try it without recycling.  

            When using a version of Elvis that has  been  compiled  with
            -DNO_RECYCLE,  you  should  be  careful to avoid making many
            small changes to a file because each individual change  will
            cause the  tmp  file  to  grow  by at least 1k.  Hitting "x"
            thirty times counts as  thirty  changes,  but  typing  "30x"
            counts as  one  change.   Also, you should occasionally do a
            ":w" followed by a ":e" to start with a fresh tmp file.  

     -DNO_SENTENCE 
            Leaves out the "(" and ")" visual mode commands.  Also,  the
            "[[",  "]]",  "{", and "}" commands will not recognize *roff
            macros.  The sections and paragraphs options go away.   This
            saves about 650 bytes in the ".text" segment.  

     -DNO_CHARSEARCH 
            Leaves   out  the  visual  commands  which  locate  a  given
            character in the current line: "f", "t", "F", "T",  ","  and
            ";".  This saves about 900 bytes.  

     -DNO_EXTENSIONS 
            Leaves out the "K" and "#" visual commands.  Also, the arrow 
            keys will  no  longer work in input mode.  (Other extensions
            are  either  inherent  in  the  design  of  elvis,  or   are
            controlled  by  more  specific  flags, or are too tiny to be
            worth removing.) This saves about 250 bytes.

     -DNO_MAGIC 
            Permanently  disables  the  "magic"  option,  so  that  most
            meta-characters   in   a   regular   expression   are  *NOT*
            recognized.  This saves about 3k of  space  in  the  ".text"
            segment,  because the complex regular expression code can be
            replaced by much simpler code.  

     -DNO_SHOWMODE 
            Permanently disables the "showmode" option, saving about 250 
            bytes.  

     -DNO_CURSORSHAPE 
            Normally, Elvis tries to adjust the shape of the cursor as a 
            reminder of which mode you're in.  The -DNO_CURSORSHAPE flag 
            disables this, saving about 150 bytes.  

     -DNO_DIGRAPH 
            To allow  entry  of  non-ASCII  characters,  Elvis  supports
            digraphs.  A digraph is a single (non-ASCII) character which 
            is   entered   as   a   combination  of  two  other  (ASCII)
            characters.   If  you  don't   need   to   input   non-ASCII
            characters,  or  if  your  keyboard supports a better way of
            entering non-ASCII characters,  then  you  can  disable  the
            digraph code and save about 450 bytes.  

     -DNO_ERRLIST 
            Elvis   adds  a  ":errlist"  command,  which  is  useful  to
            programmers.  If  you  don't  need  this  feature,  you  can
            disable it  via the -DNO_ERRLIST flag.  This will reduce the
            .text segment by about 900 bytes, and the  .bss  segment  by
            about 300 bytes.  

     -DNO_ABBR 
            The -DNO_ABBR flag disables the ":abbr" command, and reduces 
            the size of Elvis by about 600 bytes.  

     -DNO_OPTCOLS 
            When  Elvis  displays  the  current options settings via the
            ":set"  command,  the  options  are  normally  sorted   into
            columns.   The  -DNO_OPTCOLS  flag  causes the options to be
            sorted across  the  rows,  which  is  much  simpler.     The
            -DNO_OPTCOLS flag will reduce the size of your .text segment 
            by about 500 bytes.  

     -DNO_MODELINE 
            This removes all support for modelines.
