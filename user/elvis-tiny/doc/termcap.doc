E10.  TERMCAPF

        Elvis uses  fairly  standard  termcap fields for most things.  I
     invented the cursor shape names but other than that there should be 
     no surprises.  


   E10.1  Required numeric fieldsF

        :co#:   number of columns on the screen (characters per line)
        :li#:   number of lines on the screen


   E10.2  Required string fieldsF

        :ce=:   clear to end-of-line
        :cl=:   home the cursor & clear the screen
        :cm=:   move the cursor to a given row/column
        :up=:   move the cursor up one line


   E10.3  Boolean fieldsF

        :am:    auto margins - wrap when a char is written to the last column?
        :pt:    physical tabs?


   E10.4  Optional string fieldsF

        :al=:   insert a blank row on the screen
        :dl=:   delete a row from the screen
        :cd=:   clear to end of display
        :ei=:   end insert mode
        :ic=:   insert a blank character
        :im=:   start insert mode
        :dc=:   delete a character
        :sr=:   scroll reverse (insert a row at the top of the screen)
        :vb=:   visible bell
        :ti=:   terminal initialization string, to start full-screen mode
        :te=:   terminal termination, to end full-screen mode
        :ks=:   enables the cursor keypad
        :ke=:   disables the cursor keypad


   E10.5  Optional strings received from the keyboardF

        :kd=:   sequence sent by the <down arrow> key
        :kl=:   sequence sent by the <left arrow> key
        :kr=:   sequence sent by the <right arrow> key
        :ku=:   sequence sent by the <up arrow> key
        :kP=:   sequence sent by the <PgUp> key
        :kN=:   sequence sent by the <PgDn> key
        :kh=:   sequence sent by the <Home> key
        :kH=:   sequence sent by the <End> key

        Originally, termcap  didn't  have  any  names  for  the  <PgUp>,
     <PgDn>, <Home>,  and  <End>  keys.    Although the capability names
     shown in the  table  above  are  the  most  common,  they  are  -1not-0
     universal.  SCO Xenix uses :PU=:PD=:HM=:EN=: for those keys.  Also, 
     if  the four arrow keys happen to be part of a 3x3 keypad, then the
     five non-arrow keys may be named :K1=: through :K5=:, so an IBM  PC
     keyboard may be described using those names instead.  Elvis can any 
     of these names.  


   E10.6  Optional fields that describe character attributesF

        :so=: :se=:     start/end standout mode (We don't care about :sg#:)
        :us=: :ue=:     start/end underlined mode
        :md=: :me=:     start/end boldface mode
        :as=: :ae=:     start/end alternate character set (italics)
        :ug#:           visible gap left by :us=:ue=:md=:me=:as=:ae=:


   E10.7  Optional fields that affect the cursor's shapeF

        The  :cQ=: string is used by elvis immediately before exiting to
     undo the effects of the other cursor shape strings.   If  :cQ=:  is
     not given, then all other cursor shape strings are ignored.  

        :cQ=:   normal cursor
        :cX=:   cursor shape used for reading EX command -- steady underline
        :cV=:   cursor shape used for reading VI commands -- steady block
        :cI=:   cursor shape used during VI input mode -- blinking underline
        :cR=:   cursor shape used during VI replace mode -- blinking block

        If  the  capabilities above aren't given, then Elvis will try to
     use the following values instead.  

        :ve=:   normal cursor, used as :cQ=:cX=:cI=:cR=:
        :vs=:   gaudy cursor, used as :cV=:


   E10.8  An exampleF

        Here's the termcap entry I use on my Minix-ST system.   Some  of
     the fields in it have nothing to do with Elvis.  Some can only work 
     on my system; I have modified my kernel's screen driver.
