E11.  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLESF

        Elvis  examines several environment variables when it starts up.
     The values of these variables are used internally for a variety  of
     purposes.   You don't need to define all of these; on most systems,
     Elvis only requires TERM to be defined.  On  MS-DOS  systems,  even
     that is optional.  


   E11.1  TERM, TERMCAPF

        TERM tells  Elvis the name of the termcap entry to use.  TERMCAP
     may contain either the entire termcap entry, or the  full  pathname
     of the termcap file to search through.  


   E11.2  TMP, TEMPF

        These only  work  for  MS-DOS  and  Atari  TOS.  Either of these
     variables may be used to set the "directory" option, which controls 
     where temporary files are stored.  If you define  them  both,  then
     TMP is used, and TEMP is ignored.  


   E11.3  EXINITF

        This  variable  may  contain a colon-mode command, which will be
     executed after all of the  ".exrc"  files  but  before  interactive
     editing begins.  


   E11.4  SHELL, COMSPECF

        You  can use COMSPEC in MS-DOS, or SHELL in any other system, to
     specify which shell should  be  used  for  executing  commands  and
     expanding wildcards.  


   E11.5  HOMEF

        This  variable  should  give  the  full  pathname  of  your home
     directory.  Elvis needs to know the name of your home directory  so
     it can locate the ".exrc" file there.
