0. Introduction

This directory contains the following files:

  o README        this file
  o README.jis    README translated into Japanese
  o network       replacement of /etc/pcmcia/network
  o network.opt   replacement of /etc/pcmcia/network.opt


1. Install (in case you are using Slackware distribution)

1. make a back-up of the following directories: /etc/rc.d, /etc/pcmcia
2. copy 'network' and 'network.opt' to /etc/pcmcia
3. copy all the 'rc' files in the directory ../rc.d to the directory /etc/rc.d


2. Environment Variables in the Shell Script 'network'

The environment variables used in the shell script 'network' are
defined in the file 'network.opt'. The following environment
variables, which are defined in 'network.opt', are related to dhcpcd:

o DHCP:    cardmgr invokes dhcpcd if this variable is set to "y".
           This value is set to "y" in 'network.opt'.
o DHCPSTF: dhcpcd invokes the command file described by this variable
           if it is not set to the null string. This value is set to
           /etc/rc.d/rc.dhcp in 'network.opt'.
