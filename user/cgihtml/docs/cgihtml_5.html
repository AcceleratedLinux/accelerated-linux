<h2>5.1. Release notes</h2>

<h2>5.2. Future releases</h2>

<p>This library is nearing its final release.  I hope to include
FastCGI support, and API support (for Apache, Netscape, and Microsoft
servers).  I may also attempt to port it to the Macintosh, and I want
to improve generally portability.  I will most likely rewrite the API
in the next major release.  Finally, I'd like to improve the
robustness and fix all the bugs.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  Feel free to
e-mail me at
<a href="mailto:eekim@eekim.com">eekim@eekim.com.</a></p>
