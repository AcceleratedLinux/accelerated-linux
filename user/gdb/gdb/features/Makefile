# This file requires GNU make!

# This Makefile updates files in ../regformats from their XML master
# copies.  Because this relies on xsltproc, it is not normally run
# during the build process; it should be run by hand when one of the
# affected XML files is changed, and the results should be kept in the
# GDB repository.

# It can also update the C files in the features directory from their
# XML master copies.  This relies on a GDB linked with expat and
# configured for the correct architecture, so the files are again kept
# in the GDB repository.  To generate C files:
#   make GDB=/path/to/gdb XMLTOC="xml files" cfiles
