   LOCAL FUNCTION

   locate_base -- locate the base address of dynamic linker structs

   SYNOPSIS

   CORE_ADDR locate_base (void)

   DESCRIPTION

   For both the SunOS and SVR4 shared library implementations, if the
   inferior executable has been linked dynamically, there is a single
   address somewhere in the inferior's data space which is the key to
   locating all of the dynamic linker's runtime structures.  This
   address is the value of the debug base symbol.  The job of this
   function is to find and return that address, or to return 0 if there
   is no such address (the executable is statically linked for example).

   For SunOS, the job is almost trivial, since the dynamic linker and
   all of it's structures are statically linked to the executable at
   link time.  Thus the symbol for the address we are looking for has
   already been added to the minimal symbol table for the executable's
   objfile at the time the symbol file's symbols were read, and all we
   have to do is look it up there.  Note that we explicitly do NOT want
   to find the copies in the shared library.

   The SVR4 version is a bit more complicated because the address
   is contained somewhere in the dynamic info section.  We have to go
   to a lot more work to discover the address of the debug base symbol.
   Because of this complexity, we cache the value we find and return that
   value on subsequent invocations.  Note there is no copy in the
   executable symbol tables.

   LOCAL FUNCTION

   enable_break -- arrange for dynamic linker to hit breakpoint

   SYNOPSIS

   int enable_break (void)

   DESCRIPTION

   Both the SunOS and the SVR4 dynamic linkers have, as part of their
   debugger interface, support for arranging for the inferior to hit
   a breakpoint after mapping in the shared libraries.  This function
   enables that breakpoint.

   For SunOS, there is a special flag location (in_debugger) which we
   set to 1.  When the dynamic linker sees this flag set, it will set
   a breakpoint at a location known only to itself, after saving the
   original contents of that place and the breakpoint address itself,
   in it's own internal structures.  When we resume the inferior, it
   will eventually take a SIGTRAP when it runs into the breakpoint.
   We handle this (in a different place) by restoring the contents of
   the breakpointed location (which is only known after it stops),
   chasing around to locate the shared libraries that have been
   loaded, then resuming.

   For SVR4, the debugger interface structure contains a member (r_brk)
   which is statically initialized at the time the shared library is
   built, to the offset of a function (_r_debug_state) which is guaran-
   teed to be called once before mapping in a library, and again when
   the mapping is complete.  At the time we are examining this member,
   it contains only the unrelocated offset of the function, so we have
   to do our own relocation.  Later, when the dynamic linker actually
   runs, it relocates r_brk to be the actual address of _r_debug_state().

   The debugger interface structure also contains an enumeration which
   is set to either RT_ADD or RT_DELETE prior to changing the mapping,
   depending upon whether or not the library is being mapped or unmapped,
   and then set to RT_CONSISTENT after the library is mapped/unmapped.

   LOCAL FUNCTION

   special_symbol_handling -- additional shared library symbol handling

   SYNOPSIS

   void special_symbol_handling ()

   DESCRIPTION

   Once the symbols from a shared object have been loaded in the usual
   way, we are called to do any system specific symbol handling that 
   is needed.

   For SunOS4, this consisted of grunging around in the dynamic
   linkers structures to find symbol definitions for "common" symbols
   and adding them to the minimal symbol table for the runtime common
   objfile.

   However, for SVR4, there's nothing to do.

 */

/* Relocate the main executable.  This function should be called upon
   stopping the inferior process at the entry point to the program. 
   The entry point from BFD is compared to the PC and if they are
   different, the main executable is relocated by the proper amount. 
   
   As written it will only attempt to relocate executables which
   lack interpreter sections.  It seems likely that only dynamic
   linker executables will get relocated, though it should work
   properly for a position-independent static executable as well.  */

  /* Decide if the objfile needs to be relocated.  As indicated above,
     we will only be here when execution is stopped at the beginning
     of the program.  Relocation is necessary if the address at which
     we are presently stopped differs from the start address stored in
     the executable AND there's no interpreter section.  The condition
     regarding the interpreter section is very important because if
     there *is* an interpreter section, execution will begin there
     instead.  When there is an interpreter section, the start address
     is (presumably) used by the interpreter at some point to start
     execution of the program.

     If there is an interpreter, it is normal for it to be set to an
     arbitrary address at the outset.  The job of finding it is
     handled in enable_break().

     So, to summarize, relocations are necessary when there is no
     interpreter section and the start address obtained from the
     executable is different from the address at which GDB is
     currently stopped.
     
     [ The astute reader will note that we also test to make sure that
       the executable in question has the DYNAMIC flag set.  It is my
       opinion that this test is unnecessary (undesirable even).  It
       was added to avoid inadvertent relocation of an executable
       whose e_type member in the ELF header is not ET_DYN.  There may
       be a time in the future when it is desirable to do relocations
       on other types of files as well in which case this condition
       should either be removed or modified to accomodate the new file
       type.  (E.g, an ET_EXEC executable which has been built to be
       position-independent could safely be relocated by the OS if
       desired.  It is true that this violates the ABI, but the ABI
       has been known to be bent from time to time.)  - Kevin, Nov 2000. ]

	   addressesing between segments, the difference between
	   virtual addresses in memory must match the difference
	   between virtual addresses in the file.  The difference
	   between the virtual address of any segment in memory and
	   the corresponding virtual address in the file is thus a
	   single constant value for any one executable or shared
	   object in a given process.  This difference is the base
	   address.  One use of the base address is to relocate the
	   memory image of the program during dynamic linking.

	 The same language also appears in Edition 4.0 of the System V
	 ABI and is left unspecified in some of the earlier editions.  */

   GLOBAL FUNCTION

   svr4_solib_create_inferior_hook -- shared library startup support

   SYNOPSIS

   void svr4_solib_create_inferior_hook ()

   DESCRIPTION

   When gdb starts up the inferior, it nurses it along (through the
   shell) until it is ready to execute it's first instruction.  At this
   point, this function gets called via expansion of the macro
   SOLIB_CREATE_INFERIOR_HOOK.

   For SunOS executables, this first instruction is typically the
   one at "_start", or a similar text label, regardless of whether
   the executable is statically or dynamically linked.  The runtime
   startup code takes care of dynamically linking in any shared
   libraries, once gdb allows the inferior to continue.

   For SVR4 executables, this first instruction is either the first
   instruction in the dynamic linker (for dynamically linked
   executables) or the instruction at "start" for statically linked
   executables.  For dynamically linked executables, the system
   first exec's /lib/libc.so.N, which contains the dynamic linker,
   and starts it running.  The dynamic linker maps in any needed
   shared libraries, maps in the actual user executable, and then
   jumps to "start" in the user executable.

   For both SunOS shared libraries, and SVR4 shared libraries, we
   can arrange to cooperate with the dynamic linker to discover the
   names of shared libraries that are dynamically linked, and the
   base addresses to which they are linked.

   This function is responsible for discovering those names and
   addresses, and saving sufficient information about them to allow
   their symbols to be read at a later time.

   FIXME

   Between enable_break() and disable_break(), this code does not
   properly handle hitting breakpoints which the user might have
   set in the startup code or in the dynamic linker itself.  Proper
   handling will probably have to wait until the implementation is
   changed to use the "breakpoint handler function" method.

   Also, what if child has exit()ed?  Must exit loop somehow.

   a way to do arithmetic on CORE_ADDR values that respects the

   converting a 32-bit pointer to a 64-bit CORE_ADDR requires you to
   sign-extend the value.  There, simply truncating the bits above
   gdbarch_ptr_bit, as we do below, is no good.)  This should probably
