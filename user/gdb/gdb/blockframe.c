   If ADDR_IN_BLOCK is non-zero, set *ADDR_IN_BLOCK to the exact code
   address we used to choose the block.  We use this to find a source
   line, to decide which macro definitions are in scope.

   The value returned in *ADDR_IN_BLOCK isn't necessarily the frame's
   PC, and may not really be a valid PC at all.  For example, in the
   caller of a function declared to never return, the code at the
   return address will never be reached, so the call instruction may
   be the very last instruction in the block.  So the address we use
   to choose the block is actually one byte before the return address

   slot instruction.  */
