# Usage: cd src/gdb && sh ./copyright.sh
# To use a different version of emacs, set the EMACS environment
# variable before running.

# After running, update those files mentioned in $byhand by hand.
# Always review the output of this script before committing it!
# A useful command to review the output is:
#  filterdiff -x \*.c -x \*.cc -x \*.h -x \*.exp updates.diff
# This removes the bulk of the changes which are most likely
# to be correct.

####
# Configuration
####

# As of Emacs 22.0 (snapshot), wrapping and copyright updating do not
# handle these file types - all reasonable:
#  Assembly (weird comment characters, e.g. "!"); .S usually has C
#            comments, which are fine)
#  Fortran ("c" comment character)
#  igen
#  Autoconf input (dnl)
#  texinfo (@c)
#  tex (%)
#  *.defs as C
#   man
# So these need to be done by hand, as needed
