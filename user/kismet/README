Kismet configuration for Atheros based cards in UTMx00 products
===============================================================

Kismet is built in server and drone mode only. A kismet.conf file
is installed in /etc/default, and will need to be copied into /etc/config
if the configuration is not erased after netflashing in a wlan image.

The following changes need to be made to kismet.conf

ncsource needs to be set to "wlan0"
gps needs to be set to false
configdir needs to be set to /tmp/.kismet

To start the kismet server, 
type kismet_server -p /tmp 
This command starts the kismet server, and sets the log directory to /tmp
Kismet will log to a variety of formats; the pcap logs can be viewed with 
wireshark.
