TinyLogin is a suite of tiny Unix utilities for handling logging into,
being authenticated by, changing one's password for, and otherwise
maintaining users and groups on an embedded system. It also provides shadow
password support to enhance system security. TinyLogin is, as the name
implies, very small, and makes an excellent complement to BusyBox on an
embedded System. It can be used without BusyBox, of course, but I envision
them being used together most of the time.

<P>
Why is something like TinyLogin useful?

TinyLogin is a curious blend of code from a whole bunch of folks. It was
originally cobbled together by Sean Bastille &lt;<A
HREF="mailto:hightide@ginch.org">hightide@ginch.org</A>&gt; based in part
on the May of 1998 version of the shadow utilities, which can be downloaded
from: <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.ists.pwr.wroc.pl/pub/linux/shadow/">ftp://ftp.ists.pwr.wroc.pl/pub/linux/shadow/</A>
The build system, and the way in which TinyLogin invokes its component
applications has been totally rewritten, based on the build system used for
BusyBox. The code has also been majorly reworked to make it more internally
consistent, to make it use fewer global variables, etc, by Erik Andersen.

<P>
TinyLogin may be used and distributed under the terms of GNU General Public
License, with the addition of the special terms enumerated below by the
shadow utilities license (a BSD style license which allows me to make
future releases under the GPL).

TinyLogin, like BusyBox, is now modularized to easily allow you to build
only the components you need, thereby reducing binary size. To turn off
unwanted TinyLogin components, simply edit the file tinylogin.def.h and
comment out the parts you do not want using C++ style (//) comments.

<P>
After the build is complete a tinylogin.links file is generated which is
then used by 'make install' to create symlinks to the tinylogin binary for
all compiled in functions. By default, 'make install' will place a symlink
forest into `pwd`/_install unless you have defined the PREFIX environment
variable.

I often get email from people wondering why tinylogin doesn't work. It is
almost always the case that they compiled with ``USE_SYSTEM_PWD_GRP =
true'' in the Makefile, and they are using GNU Libc, and have either failed
to install /etc/nsswitch.conf, have badly configured their
/etc/nsswitch.conf file, or have a properly configured /etc/nsswitch.conf
file but have not installed the libraries the GNU Libc is looking for
(which is determined based on the contents of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file).
To avoid these problems, I recommend that unless you have a very good
reason, you should always leave the Makefile's ``USE_SYSTEM_PWD_GRP =
false'' setting in place. This will cause tinylogin to directly use the
system's password and group files. This way, you do not need to worry about
GNU Libc's NSS at all (thereby making your embedded system even smaller).
If you absolutely must use GNU libc NSS for authentication you must include
something such as the following in your embedded systems'
/etc/nsswitch.conf file:

<P>
<PRE>  # /etc/nsswitch.conf
  # Note that if you are doing networking, 
  # other entries will also be needed.
  passwd:         compat
  group:          compat
  shadow:         compat
</PRE>
<P>
Furthermore, you will also need to include the library /lib/libnss_compat
so that GNU Libc can find it when it is needed (it is dynamicaly loaded, so
'ldd' won't tell you that you need it -- which is why I've devoted this
entire section of the manual to tell you you need it). If you want to do
something more complicated, such as authenticating vs a remote LDAP
database, well tinylogin can work just fine with that type of setup using
GNU libc NSS, but setting it up is your problem, not mine.

Currently defined functions include:

<P>
adduser, addgroup, deluser, delgroup, login, su, sulogin, passwd, getty

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_adduser">adduser</A></STRONG>
<P>
Add a user to the system

<P>
Usage: adduser [OPTIONS]... &lt;USER&gt;

<P>
Options:

<P>
<PRE>  -h &lt;directory&gt;    specify home directory
  -s &lt;shell&gt;        specify shell
  -g &lt;gecos&gt;        specify GECOS string
</PRE>
<P>
Default values are as follows:  

<P>
<PRE>  HOME=/home/$USER
  SHELL=/bin/sh
  GECOS=&quot;Embedix,,,&quot;
</PRE>
<P>
Description:

<P>
This utility adds a user to /etc/passwd and /etc/group. If shadow is
enabled /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow are also updated w/ appropriate
information. The group name is set to the same value as the user name. To
set the initial password, adduser executes passwd which presents an
interactive prompt. This makes adduser inappropriate for batch account
creation.

<P>
Normally, something like adduser is implemented in a scripting language,
but this one was implemented in C. The rationale for this was that in a
small system, one might not have space for certain Unix shell utilities
that are normally taken for granted or that one might not have space for
even a minimal perl installation. Such limitations could make making a
robust adduser implementation difficult, so the only viable option left was
to do it in C.

<P>
When implementing adduser, the semantics of Debian's adduser perl script
were used as a reference, so those of you familiar with that should notice
similarities.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_addgroup">addgroup</A></STRONG>
<P>
Add a group to the system

<P>
Usage: addgroup [OPTIONS]... &lt;GROUP&gt;

<P>
Options:

<P>
<PRE>  -g &lt;number&gt;       specify gid
</PRE>
<P>
Description:

<P>
This utility adds a group to /etc/group and if necessary, /etc/gshadow as
well. If the GID is not specified, addgroup will try to find the next
available gid within the range of [100..64000].

<HR noshade>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_deluser">deluser</A></STRONG>
<P>
Delete a user from the system

<P>
Usage: deluser &lt;USER&gt;

<P>
Description:

<P>
This utility only takes one parameter which is the user name. It will
search /etc/passwd and delete the user's account if it exists.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Although adduser adds both users and groups, deluser only deletes users.

<HR noshade>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_delgroup">delgroup</A></STRONG>
<P>
Delete a group from the system

<P>
Usage: delgroup &lt;USER&gt;

<P>
Description:

<P>
This utility only takes one parameter which is the group name. It will
search /etc/passwd and delete the group if it exists.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Although adduser adds both users and groups, delgroup only deletes
groups.

<P>
Single-user login
