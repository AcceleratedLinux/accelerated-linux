                           User-Mode-Linux mysteries

     * running more than one UML of the same name (e.g. "west") can cause
       problems.
     * running more than one UML from the same root file system is not a
       good idea.
     * all this means that running "make check" twice on the same machine
       is probably not a good idea.
     * occationally, UMLs will get stuck. This can happen like: 15134 ? T
       0:00 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east)
       [/bin/sh] 15138 ? T 0:00
       /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east) [halt]
       these will need to be killed. Note that they are in "T"racing
       mode.
     * UMLs can also hang, and will report "Tracing myself and I can't
       get out". This is a bug in UML. There are ways to find out what is
       going on and report this to the UML people, but we don't know the
       magic right now.
