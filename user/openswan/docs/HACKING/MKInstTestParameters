mkinsttest paramaters

   The basic concept of the mkinsttest test type is that it performs a
   "make install" to a temporary $DESTDIR. The resulting tree can then be
   examined to determine if it was done properly. The files can be
   uninstalled to determine if the file list was correct, or the contents
   of files can be examined more precisely.

   INSTALL_FLAGS
          If set, then an install will be done. This provides the set of
          flags to provide for the install. The target to be used
          (usually "install") must be among the flags.

   POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT
          If set, a script to run after initial "make install". Two
          arguments are provided: an absolute path to the root of the
          FreeSWAN src tree, and an absolute path to the temporary
          installation area.

   INSTALL2_FLAGS
          If set, a second install will be done using these flags.
          Similarly to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target must be among the flags.

   UNINSTALL_FLAGS
          If set, an uninstall will be done using these flags. Similarly
          to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target (usually "uninstall") must be
          among the flags.

   REF_FIND_f_l_OUTPUT
          If set, a find $ROOT ( -type f -or -type -l ) will be done to
          get a list of a real files and symlinks. The resulting file
          will be compared to the file listed by this option.

   REF_FILE_CONTENTS
          If set, it should point to a file containing records for the
          form:

  reffile   samplefile

          one record per line. A diff between the provided reference
          file, and the sample file (located in the temporary
          installation root) will be done for each record.
