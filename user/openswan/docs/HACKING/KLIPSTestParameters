KLIPStest paramaters

   The klipstest function starts a program
   (testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig) to setup a bunch of I/O sockets
   (that simulate network interfaces). It then exports the references to
   these sockets to the environment and invokes (using system()) a given
   script. It waits for the script to finish.

   The script invoked (testing/utils/host-test.tcl) is a TCL [6]expect
   script that arranges to start the UML and configure it appropriately
   for the test. The configuration is done with the script given above
   for INIT_SCRIPT. The TCL script then forks, leaves the UML in the
   background and exits. uml_netjig continues. It then starts listening
   to the simulated network answering ARPs and inserting packets as
   appropriate.

   The klipstest function invokes uml_netjig with arguments to capture
   output from network interface(s) and insert packets as appropriate:

   PUB_INPUT
          a [7]pcap file to feed in on the public (encrypted) interface.
          (typically, eth1)

   PRIV_INPUT
          a pcap file to feed in on the private (plain-text) interface
          (typically, eth0).

   REF_PUB_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the public
          (eth1) interface are captured to a [8]pcap file by uml_netjig.
          The klipstest function then uses tcpdump on the file to produce
          text output, which is compared to the file given.

   REF_PUB_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   REF_PRIV_OUTPUT
          a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
          (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
          tcpdump, as with REFPUBOUTPUT.

   REF_PRIV_FILTER
          a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
          processing. Defaults to "cat".

   EXITONEMPTY
          a flag for uml_netjig. It should contain "--exitonempty" of
          uml_netjig should exit when all of the input
          (PUBINPUT,PRIVINPUT) packets have been injected.

   ARPREPLY
          a flag for uml_netjig. It should contain "--arpreply" if
          uml_netjig should reply to ARP requests. One will typically set
          this to avoid having to fudge the ARP cache manually.

   TCPDUMPFLAGS
          a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
          output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and
          often "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher
          only) for ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is
          provided automatically

   NETJIG_EXTRA
          additional comments to be sent to the netjig. This may arrange
          to record or create additional networks, or may toggle options.
