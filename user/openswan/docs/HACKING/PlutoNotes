Pluto has three helpers.

# (PlutoAdns). a DNS resolver that uses libc resolver library, and
therefore doesn't follow CNAMEs, etc.

# (LwDnsQ). a DNS resolver that uses the lwresd interface, and therefore can
follow CNAMEs.

# (PlutoHelper). A sub-process of pluto that performs cryptographic
operations.


Pluto has StateObjects which represent an on-going negotiation.


Pluto will occasionally deal with [[Notifications]].

Pluto will [[CoreDump]].
