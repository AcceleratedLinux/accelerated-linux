For a number of months the Openswan project will move from GIT to CVS.

See [[HowToGit]]

This is the operating proceedure for working with the two trees.

First, the GIT tree is the master tree.

The CVS tree is the public release tree. The CVS tree is duplicated via rsync
to anoncvs.openswan.org. Anything committed to that tree will become public 
without 30 minutes.

The GIT tree has a branch called "public" which is pushed to 
	http://git.openswan.org/public/scm/openswan.git/

Anything placed on that branch will be made public.

To generate patches from CVS to apply to the public branch, you need to figure it out.
There is nothing simple to automate this. Dates can be used, as in:
	"cvs diff -u -Dyesterday | (cd ../public.git && patch -p0)
	cg-commit
	git checkout cvs
	git pull . public
	git checkout public

To determine what patches might need to be pulled up to the public branch,
another branch is also used, called "cvs". The process is to pull the code
up to the public branch, and then to do:
	cd public.git
	git-format-patch cvs

this generates patches to be applied to CVS. After the patches have been applied,
the state of the CVS should be updated:
	git checkout cvs
	git pull . public
	git checkout public
