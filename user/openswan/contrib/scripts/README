This directory contains scripts that mimic certain KLIPS-only commands
when using NETKEY. These may fold back into the distribution later on,
or get replaced by new code. Output is not guaranteed to be identical
to the KLIPS versions.

eroute: replacement for KLIPS' "ipsec eroute"
look: replacement for KLIPS' "ipsec look"

Install: replace the KLIPS script in /usr/local/libexec/ipsec/ with a
version from this directory.
