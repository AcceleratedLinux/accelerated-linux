Subject: [Design] changes to ipsec.conf

We are changing ipsec.conf for the 2.0 series of FreeS/WAN.

OE is enabled by default.  This is accomplished by automatically
defining a conn "OEself" UNLESS the sysadmin defines one with the same
name:

conn OEself
	# authby=rsasig   # default
	left=%defaultroute
	leftrsasigkey=%dnsondemand	# default
	right=%opportunistic
	rightrsasigkey=%dnsondemand	# default
	keyingtries=3
	ikelifetime=1h
	keylife=1h	# default
	rekey=no
	# disablearrivalcheck=no  # default
	auto=route

This will only work if %defaultroute works.
The leftid will be the resulting IP address (won't work if
you haven't filled in the reverse DNS entry).
Unlike other conns, nothing in this implicit conn is changed by conn %default.

We'd like a better name.  A conn name starting with % cannot be
defined by the sysadmin, so that is out.  Names that haven't grabbed
us: OEhost, OElocalhost, OEthishost, OEforself, OE4self.

There is no requirement to have /etc/ipsec.conf.  If you do, the first
significant line (non-blank, non-comment) must be (not indented):
version 2.0
This signifies that the file was intended for FreeS/WAN version 2.0.


The following table shows most changes.  "-" means that the option
doesn't exist.  "Recent Boilerplate" shows the effect of the "conn
%default" in the automatically installed /etc/ipsec.conf (not
installed if you already had one).

Option		Old Default	Recent Boilerplate	New Default
======		===========	==================	===========

config setup:
interfaces	""		%defaultroute		%defaultroute
plutoload	""		%search			- [same as %search]
plutostart	""		%search			- [same as %search]
uniqueids	no		yes			yes
rp_filter	-		-			0
plutowait	yes		yes			no
dump		no		no			- [use dumpdir]
plutobackgroundload ignored	ignored			-
no_eroute_pass	no		no			- [use packetdefault]

conn %default:
keyingtries	3		0			%forever [0 means this]
disablearrivalcheck  yes	no			no
authby		secret		rsasig			rsasig
leftrsasigkey	""		%dnsondemand		%dnsondemand
rightrsasigkey	""		%dnsondemand		%dnsondemand
lifetime	==keylife	==keylife		- [use keylife]
rekeystart	==rekeymargin	==rekeymargin		- [use rekeymargin]
rekeytries	==keyingtries	==keyingtries		- [use keyingtries]

======		===========	==================	===========
Option		Old Default	Recent Boilerplate	New Default


The auto= mechanism has been extended to support manual conns.  If you
specify auto=manual in a conn, an "ipsec manual" will be performed on
it at startup (ipsec setup start).


There is a new config setup option "rp_filter".  It controls
	/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/PHYS/rp_filter
for each PHYSical IP interface used by FreeS/WAN.  Settings are:
	%unchanged	do not touch (but warn if wrong)
	0		set to 0; default; means: no filtering
	1		set to 1; means: loose filter
	2		set to 1; means: strict filter
0 is often necessary for FreeS/WAN to function.  Some folks
want other settings.  Shutting down FreeS/WAN does not restore
the original value.

Currently ikelife defaults to 1 hour and keylife defaults to 8 hours.
There have been some rumblings that these are the wrong defaults, but
it isn't clear what would be best.  Perhaps both should be closer.
Any thoughts of what these should be?  Any Road Warrior or OE conn
should probably have carefully thought-out values explicitly
specified.  The settings don't matter much for VPN connections.

keyingtries=%forever is the new improved notation for keyingtries=0.
Eventually the 0 notation will be eliminated.

Some options can now be set to %none to signify no setting.  Otherwise
there would be no way for the user to override a default setting:
	leftrsasigkey, rightrsasigkey [added in 1.98]
	interfaces
