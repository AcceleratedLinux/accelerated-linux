  <term><emphasis remap='B'>compress</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>whether IPComp compression of content is proposed on the connection
(link-level compression does not work on encrypted data,
so to be effective, compression must be done <emphasis remap='I'>before</emphasis> encryption);
acceptable values are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
(the default).
The two ends need not agree.
A value of
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>
causes IPsec to propose both compressed and uncompressed,
and prefer compressed.
A value of
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
prevents IPsec from proposing compression;
a proposal to compress will still be accepted.</para>
