  <term><emphasis remap='B'>leftca</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>specifies the authorized Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the
certificate of the peer. If undefined, it defaults to the CA that signed
the certificate specified in <emphasis remap='B'>leftcert</emphasis>.
The special <emphasis remap='B'>rightca=%same</emphasis> is implied when
not specifying a <emphasis remap='B'>rightca</emphasis> and means that
only peers with certificates signed by the same CA as the leftca will be
allowed. This option is only useful in complex multi CA certificate
situations. When using a single CA, it can be safely omitted for both
left and right.
