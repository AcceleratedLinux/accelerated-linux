Note that spi is only supported on the classic KLIPS stack\&. It is not supported on any other stack and will be completely removed in future versions\&. A replacement command still needs to be designed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fISpigrp\fR
groups IPSEC Security Associations (SAs) together or ungroups previously grouped SAs\&. An entry in the IPSEC extended routing table can only point (via a destination address, a Security Parameters Index (SPI) and a protocol identifier) to one SA\&. If more than one transform must be applied to a given type of packet, this can be accomplished by setting up several SAs with the same destination address but potentially different SPIs and protocols, and grouping them with
\fIspigrp\fR\&.
.PP
The SAs to be grouped, specified by destination address (DNS name lookup, IPv4 dotted quad or IPv6 coloned hex), SPI (\'0x\'\-prefixed hexadecimal number) and protocol ("ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun"), are listed from the inside transform to the outside; in other words, the transforms are applied in the order of the command line and removed in the reverse order\&. The resulting SA group is referred to by its first SA (by
\fIaf1\fR,
\fIdst1\fR,
\fIspi1\fR
and
\fIproto1\fR)\&.
.PP
The \-\-said option indicates that the SA IDs are to be specified as one argument each, in the format <proto><af><spi>@<dest>\&. The SA IDs must all be specified as separate parameters without the \-\-said option or all as monolithic parameters after the \-\-said option\&.
.PP
The SAs must already exist and must not already be part of a group\&.
.PP
If
\fIspigrp\fR
is invoked with only one SA specification, it ungroups the previously\-grouped set of SAs containing the SA specified\&.
.PP
The \-\-label option identifies all responses from that command invocation with a user\-supplied label, provided as an argument to the label option\&. This can be helpful for debugging one invocation of the command out of a large number\&.
.PP
The command form with no additional arguments lists the contents of /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp\&. The format of /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp is discussed in ipsec_spigrp(5)\&.

Yes, it really is limited to a maximum of four SAs, although admittedly it\'s hard to see why you would need more\&.
