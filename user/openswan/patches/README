This directory contains patches that can be applied without the use of
any "make" target, such as 'make nattpatch' or 'make kpatch'. Since
these make targets relied on us tweaking the patch to work against many
versioned kernels, we decided to switch to providing patches meant to
be used on 1 specific version.

It currently contains some old versions of the klips and nat patches,
and the ng-patch (ipsec saref for klips)
