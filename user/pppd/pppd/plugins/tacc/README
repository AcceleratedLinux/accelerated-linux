INTRODUCTION

This distribution contains:

	* libtac		TACACS+ client library implementing necessary
			 		subset of TACACS+ functionality
	* tacc			simple TACACS+ client and login utility
	* pppd-*.patch	pppd TACACS+ driver for versions 2.2.0g
					and 2.3.4

NEWS

Jean-Louis Noel <jln@stben.be> has written a plugin for
pppd-2.3.11 and higher, which cleanly solves problem with
new pppd versions. Now you don't need to patch pppd sources
to use TACACS+. The plugin source and installation instructions
are avaiable at http://www.stben.be/tacacs/.

NOTE

The 1.6.x versions of libtac/tacc are quite stable now and development
is discontinued. Instead, I'm currently writing version 2.0 which will
less a quick hack (which 1.6 really is), and more a protocol implementation.
New 1.6 versions will be only bugfixes.

INSTALLATION

1. Edit and configure files:

	* tacc.c
	* Makefile
	* lib/Makefile

2. Type 'make'. This should produce library (lib/libtac.a)
	and tacc program.

3. 'make install' will copy the 'tacc' binary program to /usr/local/sbin
	and 'tacc.1' manual page to /usr/local/man/man1.

4. If you want pppd driver built, copy patch for proper pppd version
	to the top of pppd source code tree (e.g. /usr/src/ppp-2.3.4)
	and type 'patch -p0 <ppp-2.x.x.patch'

5. Configure and make pppd as described in file README.tacacs from pppd
   directory.

DOCUMENTATION
