FILES.TXT for the Configuration Directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes the important files in this directory. The Mbedthis
AppWeb build system is based on the GNU autoconf system. To enhance portability
to non-unix systems, pure autoconf is not used.

The key directories and files are:
