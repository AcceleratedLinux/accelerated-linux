Subject: [PATCH] user/gpsd: poll for one packet at a time

Exit the device polling loop when a full packet has been received and
parsed, allowing other devices to be serviced - and gpsd clients to
connect - even if the device delivers a full packet at every single
read, as does, for example, the Navilock NL-82012U external USB device.
