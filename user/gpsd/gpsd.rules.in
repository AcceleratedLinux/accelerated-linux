# GPSes don't have their own USB device class.  They're serial-over-USB
# devices, so what you see is actually the ID of the serial-over-USB chip.
# Fortunately, just two of these account for over 80% of consumer-grade
# GPS sensors.  The gpsd.hotplug wrapper script will tell a running gpsd
# that it should look at the device that just went active, because it
# might be a GPS.
#
# The following setup works on Debian and Ubuntu - something similar
# will apply on other distributions:
#
#   /lib/udev/rules.d/25-gpsd.rules
#   /lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug
#
# Setting the link in /lib/udev/rules.d activates the rule and determines
# when to run it on boot (similar to init.d processing).
