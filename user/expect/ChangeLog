2002-03-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* exp_main_sub.c: Fixed typo in merge of #459646. Thanks to Hemang Lavana.

 	* exp_log.c (expStdoutLogU): Merged fix for SF Bug #513382 into
	  the HEAD (The source of the patch is "expect-sf418892-sf439042-branch").

	  Use Tcl_WriteChars/Tcl_Flush instead of 'fwrite' for tcl 8.1 and
	  beyond to enforce correct conversion of the internal UTF/8 into
	  the external representation.

	* Merged fix for SF Bug #459646 into the HEAD (The source of the
	  patch is "expect-sf418892-sf439042-branch").

	* Merged fix for SF Bug #439042 into the HEAD (The source of the
	  patch is "expect-sf418892-sf439042-branch").

	* Merged fix for SF Bug #418892 into the HEAD (The source of the
	  patch is "expect-sf418892-sf439042-branch").

2002-03-23  Don Libes  <libes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Andreas Kupries mods to provide CONST support per TIP 27 (Fixed
	  SF Patch #525074).

2002-02-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* expect.c: Applied patch by Don Libes fixing improper
	  internationalization.

2002-02-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* expect.man: Changed the paragraph about [exp_continue] to
	  contain information about the flag "-continue_timer". This fixes
	  the bug SF #520630.

2002-02-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* expect.man: Changed abbreviation of "-notransfer" from "-n" to
	  "-not". "-n" is no longer unique due to the addition of
	  "-nocase". This fixes the bug SF #514994.

2002-02-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Applied patch for SF #514590 to correct behaviour of expect when
	  expecting and send from and to bogus spawn id's.

2002-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Resynchronization of SourceForge with Don's sources to Expect
	  version 5.34. The changes are

	  Don Porter <don.porter@nist.gov> provided package-related fixes
	  for test suite.

	  Brian Theado <brian.theado@usa.net> noted that interact's -re
	  support broke when offsets kicked in.  Turned out that the
	  regexp engine supports them during execution but the results are
	  delivered RELATIVE to the offset.  (I suspect this was done
	  due to expediency.)

2001-12-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* exp_inter.c: Applied patch posted by Don libes to c.l.t. on his
	  behalf to keep the SF repository in sync with his changes. Don's
	  notes: I obviously missed the fact that although
	  "Tcl_RegExpExecObj" supports offsets, they aren't delivered to
	  "Tcl_RegExpGetInfo".

2001-09-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* 'telco-tec-win32-branch' branch created.

2001-08-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Dbg.c (Dbg_On): fixed handling of stepping. [Bug: #446412]

2000-04-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@welcomehome.org>

	* pty_termios.h: Only include stropts.h if it exists, rather than
	deciding it exists based on HAVE_PTMX.
	* configure.in: Make sure libpt exists, rather than blindly using
	it for all our configure tests, which then all fail. Also assume
	our svr4 style ptys are broken, if /dev/ptmx exists, but stropts.h
	doesn't exist.
	
1999-08-31  Jennifer Hom  <jenn@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Changed test target to source tests/all.tcl instead
	of tests/all

	removed tests/all and tests/defs, and added tests/all.tcl 

1999-06-22    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* expect.c: Fixed bug in token parsing where index was not being
	incremented properly.

	* configure.in: Changed version number to 5.31.

	* aclocal.m4: Fixed CY_AC_LOAD_TKCONFIG so it tests for Tk_Init
	instead of Tk_Main (which is only a macro in 8.1 and later).  Also
	added TCL_BUILD_LIB_SPEC to the set of flags used in this test to
	avoid linker errors.	

	* Dbgconfig.in: move CY_*_TCLCONFIG tests below AC_PROG_CC so it
	will work with gcc

Thu Mar 20 14:27:45 1997  Geoffrey Noer  <noer@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: don't check if stty reads stdout for
	i[[3456]]86-*-sysv4.2MP during config; hard code instead

Fri Sep 27 10:15:48 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@creche.cygnus.com>

	* expect.c (exp_i_read): Pass interp as first arg to exp_error.
	* configure.in (stty_reads_stdout): /bin/stty on OSF2.0, OSF3.2,
	HPUX 9.X, HPUX 10.X guesses wrong, so set value explicitly.

Mon Sep  9 10:29:32 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@creche.cygnus.com>

	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Feb 12 23:11:38 1996  Rob Savoye  <rob@chinadoll>

	* aclocal.m4: Fix typo of ac_cv_tkh to be ac_cv_tclh so it works
	on all systems.
	* configure, DBGconfigure, testsuite/configure: Regenerated with
	autoconf 2.7.

Tue Feb  6 11:48:05 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@creche.cygnus.com>

	* exp_clib.c, exp_printify.c, expect_comm.h: For Tcl 7.5 and
	greater, use ../compat/stdlib.h, not compat/stdlib.h.

Tue Jan 30 12:21:37 1996  Fred Fish  <fnf@kalessin.cygnus.com>

	* exp_regexp.c (regmatch, regrepeat): Only declare strchr if it is not

	* exp_command.c (exp_init_most_cmds): Set exp_close_files_interp.

Thu Jan 11 09:43:14 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@creche.cygnus.com>

	* exp_closetcl.c (exp_close_files_interp): New variable for Tcl
	7.5.
	(exp_close_tcl_files): Updated for Tcl 7.5.

	Prototype and varargs changes:

	(CY_AC_PATH_TKLIB): Handle Tk 4.1 and greater.  Properly quote
	argument to AC_REQUIRE.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Tue Jan  9 16:26:47 1996  Rob Savoye  <rob@chinadoll.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Change SHORT_BINDIR to $prefix, rather than
	exec_prefix. This is only used to store the platform independant
	expect scripts.

Dec 18 17:22:05 1995  Brendan Kehoe  <brendan@lisa.cygnus.com>

        * configure.in, configure: For a solaris2 machine doing a static
        build, add `-ldl -lw' to avoid unresolved refs using the
        OpenWindows libraries.

Wed Nov 22 08:49:01 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@chinadollchinadoll.cygnus.com>

	* Most files: Update to expect 5.18.1.

Fri Nov 17 17:31:55 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@chinadoll.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Add support for SCO OpenServer. It doesn't like
	the trap either.

Thu Nov 16 09:28:53 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@chinadoll.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use $host to get the OS type rather than trying to
	get the host name ourselves. Use the $host to set the
	STTY_READS_STDOUT for hosts were the test is known to fail. It
	also now configures in the background.
	* configure.in, Dbgconfig.in, testsuite/configure.in: Use
	AC_PROG_CC again since Cygnus configure now does the sames thing.

Mon Oct 30 18:16:48 1995  Jason Molenda  (crash@phydeaux.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (no_tk): zero out X_PROGS if we can't find tk

	(expectk, expectk.tc, tk): use X11_LDFLAGS & X11_LIBS.

	* configure.in (X11HDIR, X11_LIB_FLAGS, X11_LIB): Use X11_CFLAGS,
	X11_LDFLAGS, X11_LIBS.  Link X11 statically on Solaris, SunOS and
	HPUX.

Thu Oct 19 20:55:54 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove extraneous tabs and blanks in otherwise
	empty lines.  That confuses older non-GNU versions of "make".

Mon Oct  9 20:58:50 1995  Jason Molenda  (crash@phydeaux.cygnus.com)

	* testsuite/aclocal.m4: New file.  Include ../aclocal.m4.

Thu Aug 31 00:16:26 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* HISTORY, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, exp_command.h, exp_inter.c,
	exp_main_tk.c, exp_pty.c, expect.c, tests/all,
	testsuite/Makefile.in. Update to the 5.18.0 release. Minor
	changes.

Thu Aug 17 18:47:21 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	HAVE_PTMX are defined (as happens for hpux10).

Thu Jul 27 16:31:23 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (configure): Removed rule that automatically
	rebuilds configure script.  Users might not have autoconf.

Tue Jul 18 23:15:03 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@fishbowl>

	* expect.c (Exp_ExpectGlobalCmd):  Cast ckrealloc first arg to char*.

Sun Jun 18 13:02:41 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@amigalib.com>

	* configure, configure.in (XLIBS):  When adding -lX11, also preserve
	the previous libraries that we went to the trouble of finding.

Sun Jun 18 12:15:44 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@amigalib.com>

	* Makefile.in (exp_clib.o): Add dependencies.

Mon May  1 16:50:22 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Also set XINCLUDES in the Makefile.

Fri Apr 28 18:56:02 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Create a clone of AC_C_CROSS called CY_C_CROSS that
	has better error handling in case the native compiler is hosed. 
	* aclocal.m4: Look for tcl and tk directories as just tcl (and tk)
	or tcl[0-9] (and tk[0-9)] so it doesn't match the tclX
	release. Print an error and exit if any of the --with-{tcl,tk}*
	options are used and point to bogus paths. Based Tcl header search
	on tclInt./h rather than tcl.h.
	* Makefile.in: Add dependancies for back in for configure and
	Dbgconfigure targets.

Mon Apr 24 16:46:01 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* exp_command.c, exp_event.h, exp_inter.c, exp_main_tk.c,
	exp_poll.c, exp_select.c, exp_simple.c, exp_tk.c, exp_trap.c,
	exp_tty.c, FAQ, README, HISTORY: Update to expect 5.16.3.

Fri Apr 14 12:00:39 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Copy Dbg_cf.h to objdir, not srcdir.

Tue Apr 11 18:52:24 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Split the macros so header and library searches are
	seperate macros. AC_PATH_{TCL,TK} nows only calls the macros. Lots
	of optimization to the AC_PATH_T* macros. Supports the use of
	--with-tclinclude, --with-tcllib, --with-tkinclude, --with-tklib
	to specify alternative search dirs for tcl and tk stuff.
	* Makefile.in, testsuite/Makefile.in: Re-write targets for
	configure, Dbgconfigure so they work in an unconfigured srcdir.
	* configure.in: Put AC_PATH_X before AC_PATH_TK and make the TK
	test conditional. Fix how Dbgconfigure gets passed the Tcl header
	dir to use --with-PACKAGE which is much simpler. Removed the test
	for user override of X search paths since AC_PATH_X uses.
	--x-includes and --x-libraries instead.
	* Dbgconfig.in: Use AC_PATH_TCLH to find just the headers, and
	test for LynxOS.
	* debugger/: Remove directory. Recursive configuring is so much
	easier... 
	* DbgMkfl.in, Dbg_cf.h.in, Dbg.c, Dbg.h, Dbgconfigure,
	Dbgconfig.in: Sigh, moved back to the top-level expect directory.

Wed Apr  5 17:25:45 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Add a trap so the configure runs in the
	background.

Thu Mar 16 16:56:08 1995  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* debugger: New directory for the Tcl debugger.
	* debugger/Dbg.c, debugger/Dbg.h, debugger/Dbg_cf.h.in: Moved from
	the top level expect directory so it builds standalone.
	* DbgMkfl.in, debugger/Makefile.in: Moved to debugger dir and
	renamed.
	* install-sh, mkinstalldirs: New files borrowed from the autoconf
	distribution.
	* aclocal.m4: New autoconf macros.
	* Makefile.in: Tweaked so it's recursive.
	* configure.in: Use new macros in aclocal.m4 rather than hunting
	for the Tcl and Tk stuff ourseleves.
	* debugger/Makefile.in: Build debugger standalone.
	* testsuite/Makefile.in, testsuite/configure.in: New files for
	autoconf support.
	* exp_test.c, testsuite/exp_test.c: Move test file.

Fri Jan 13 15:30:30 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (check): Pass EXPECT correctly to runtest.

Thu Oct 20 18:04:06 1994  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add X11_INCLUDE_FLAGS so top level flags get used
	too.

Tue Jun 14 12:32:07 1994  David J. Mackenzie  (djm@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* aclocal.m4: Copy from TCL directory.
	* configure.in: Improve checks for installed Tcl and Tk.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Tue Jun  7 13:52:34 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean, realclean): New targets.

Wed May 18 12:21:06 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): Add another ``else true''.

Fri Apr 29 16:49:36 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): Always use else in if conditional to
	avoid Ultrix sh bug.

Mon Apr 11 15:22:12 1994  Rob Savoye  (rob@cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Upgrade to the new "official" beta release of expect 5.7.

Tue Aug 17 20:17:40 1993  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* pty_termios.c, exp_command.c, configure.in: Add support for
	using ptmx_bsd's if they exist. Only found on OSF/1. (patch
	applied from Gregory Depp <depp@osf.org>

Fri Jun  4 08:55:22 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (TCLLIB): If ../tcl/libtcl.a does not exist, use
	-ltcl.

	bounds. (ok since it doesn't get used).

Mon May 17 19:51:52 1993  Rob Savoye  (rob@cygnus.com)

	rather than "@:" if it can't be found.
 
Thu Apr 15 14:11:50 1993  Rob Savoye  (rob@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: If using ptmx's (SVR4 style pty's)
	then check for libpt.a too.

Thu Apr  8 17:13:39 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: all doesn't depend on $(SCRIPTS).  When building
	$(SCRIPTS) using fixline & sources in $(srcdir), not the current
	directory.  When installing manpages, install from $(srcdir).
	Don't install like "install foo $(bindir)" but rather "install foo
	$(bindir)/foo".  

Mon Mar 22 23:56:29 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: add check & installcheck targets

Tue Mar  2 20:28:30 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, configure: declare SETUID to be @: instead of echo

	* pty_termios.c: declare ptynum

	* Makefile.in: a number of changes, including use of the AR and
	ARFLAGS variables, the appropriate variables for X11 (as passed
	down from the top level Makefile), clean up some doc lines

Mon Mar  1 15:05:40 1993  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, defs.h.in: Fixed problem for systems that think
	getpty() should be _getpty().

	* exp_tty.h: Defines portable tty macros.
	* pty_termios.c: New file, slightly based on pty_usg.c. Uses
	portable macros and also supports termio.
