# Start telnet and when you press ^Z, put telnet in background and save any
# remaining output in "telnet.log".  You can actually apply this technique
# to any interactive program - I just chose telnet here.

spawn -ignore HUP telnet $argv		;# start telnet

expect -re .+ {				;# and record everything to it
