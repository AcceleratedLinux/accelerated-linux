.TH MULTIXTERM 1 "16 August 2002"
.SH NAME
multixterm \- drive multiple xterms separately or together
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B multixterm
[
.I args
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Multixterm creates multiple xterms that can be driven together
or separately.

In its simplest form, multixterm is run with no arguments and
commands are interactively entered in the first entry field.
Press return (or click the "new xterm" button) to create a new
xterm running that command.

Keystrokes in the "stdin window" are redirected to all xterms
started by multixterm.  xterms may be driven separately simply
by focusing on them.

The stdin window must have the focus for keystrokes to be sent
to the xterms.  When it has the focus, the color changes to
aquamarine.  As characters are entered, the color changes to
green for a second.  This provides feedback since characters
are not echoed in the stdin window.

Typing in the stdin window while holding down the alt or meta
keys sends an escape character before the typed characters.
This provides support for programs such as emacs.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS
.TP 4
-xa
The optional \-xa argument indicates arguments to pass to
xterm.

.TP
-xc
The optional \-xc argument indicates a command to be run in
each named xterm (see \-xn).  With no \-xc argument, the command
is the current shell.

.TP 4
-xd
The optional \-xd argument indicates a directory to search for
files that will appear in the Files menu.  By default, the
directory is: ~/lib/multixterm

.TP 4
-xf
The optional \-xf argument indicates a file to be read at
startup.  See FILES below for more info.

.TP 4
-xn
The optional \-xn argument indicates a name for each xterm.
This name will also be substituted for any %n in the command
argument (see \-xc).

.TP 4
-xv
The optional \-xv flag puts multixterm into a verbose mode
where it will describe some of the things it is doing
internally.  The verbose output is not intended to be
understandable to anyone but the author.

.RE
Less common options may be changed by the startup file (see
FILES below).

All the usual X and wish flags are supported (i.e., \-display,
\-name).  There are so many of them that to avoid colliding and
make them easy to remember, all the multixterm flags begin
with \-x.

If any arguments do not match the flags above, the remainder of the
command line is made available for user processing.  By default, the
remainder is used as a list of xterm names in the style of \-xn.  The
default behavior may be changed using the .multixtermrc file (see DOT
FILE below).

.SH "EXAMPLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS"
The following command line starts up two xterms using ssh to
the hosts bud and dexter.

	multixterm \-xc "ssh %n" bud dexter

.SH FILES
Command files may be used to drive or initialize multixterm.
The File menu may be used to invoke other files.  If files
exist in the command file directory (see \-xd above), they will
appear in the File menu.  Files may also be loaded by using
File->Open.  Any filename is acceptable but the File->Open
browser defaults to files with a .mxt suffix.

Files are written in Tcl and may change any variables or
invoke any procedures.  The primary variables of interest are 'xtermCmd'
which identifies the command (see \-xc) and 'xtermNames'
which is a list of names (see \-xn).  The procedure
xtermStartAll, starts xterms for each name in the list.  Other
variables and procedures may be discovered by examining
multixterm itself.

.SH "EXAMPLE FILE"
The following file does the same thing as the earlier example
command line:
.nf

	# start two xterms connected to bud and dexter
	set xtermCmd "ssh %n"
	set xtermNames {bud dexter}
	xtermStartAll

.fi
.SH "DOT FILE"
At startup, multixterm reads ~/.multixtermrc if present.  This
is similar to the command files (see FILES above) except
that .multixtermrc may not call xtermStartAll.  Instead it is
called implicitly, similar to the way that it is implicit in
the command line use of \-xn.

The following example .multixtermrc file makes every xterm run
ssh to the hosts named on the command line.

	set xtermCmd "ssh %n"

Then multixterm could be called simply:

	multixterm bud dexter

If any command-line argument does not match a multixterm flag,
the remainder of the command line is made available to .multixtermrc
in the argv variable.  If argv is non-empty when .multixtermrc returns, it is assigned to xtermNames unless xtermNames is non-empty in which case, the
content of argv is ignored.

Commands from multixterm are evaluated early in the
initialization of multixterm.  Anything that must be done late
in the initialization (such as adding additional bindings to
the user interface) may be done by putting the commands inside
a procedure called "initLate".

.SH MENUS
Except as otherwise noted, the menus are self-explanatory.
Some of the menus have dashed lines as the first entry.
Clicking on the dashed lines will "tear off" the menus.

.SH "USAGE SUGGESTION \- ALIASES AND COMMAND FILES"
Aliases may be used to store lengthy command-line invocations.
Command files can be also be used to store such invocations
as well as providing a convenient way to share configurations.

Tcl is a general-purpose language.  Thus multixterm command
files can be extremely flexible, such as loading hostnames
from other programs or files that may change from day-to-day.
In addition, command files can be used for other purposes.
For example, command files may be used to prepared common
canned interaction sequences.  For example, the command to
send the same string to all xterms is:

    xtermSend "a particularly long string"

The File menu (torn-off) makes canned sequences particularly
convenient.  Interactions could also be bound to a mouse button,
keystroke, or added to a menu via the .multixtermrc file.

The following .multixtermrc causes tiny xterms to tile across
and down the screen.  (You may have to adjust the parameters
for your screen.)  This can be very helpful when dealing with
large numbers of xterms.
.nf

    set yPos 0
    set xPos 0

    trace variable xtermArgs r traceArgs

    proc traceArgs {args} {
        global xPos yPos
        set ::xtermArgs "-geometry 80x12+$xPos+$yPos \-font 6x10"
        if {$xPos} {
            set xPos 0
            incr yPos 145
            if {$yPos > 800} {set yPos 0}
        } else {
            set xPos 500
        }
    }
.fi

The xtermArgs variable in the code above is the variable corresponding
to the \-xa argument.

xterms can be also be created directly.  The following command file
creates three xterms overlapped
horizontally:
.nf

    set xPos 0
    foreach name {bud dexter hotdog} {
        set ::xtermArgs "-geometry 80x12+$xPos+0 \-font 6x10"
        set ::xtermNames $name
        xtermStartAll
        incr xPos 300
    }

.fi
.SH "USAGE SUGGESTION \- SELECTING HOSTS BY NICKNAME"
The following .multixtermrc shows an example of changing the
default handling of the arguments from hostnames to a filename
containing hostnames:

	set xtermNames [exec cat $argv]

The following is a variation, retrieving the host names from
the yp database:

	set xtermNames [exec ypcat $argv]

The following hardcodes two sets of hosts, so that you can
call multixterm with either "cluster1" or "cluster2":
.nf

	switch $argv {
            cluster1 {
                set xtermNames "bud dexter"
            }
            cluster2 {
                set xtermNames "frank hotdog weiner"
            }
        }

.fi


.SH COMPARE/CONTRAST
It is worth comparing multixterm to xkibitz.  Multixterm
connects a separate process to each xterm.  xkibitz connects
the same process to each xterm.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Multixterm provides no way to remotely control scrollbars,
resize, and most other window system related functions.

Multixterm can only control new xterms that multixterm itself
has started.

As a convenience, the File menu shows a limited number of
files.  To show all the files, use File->Open.

.SH FILES
$DOTDIR/.multixtermrc   initial command file
.br
~/.multixtermrc         fallback command file
.br
~/lib/multixterm/       default command file directory

.SH BUGS
If multixterm is killed using an uncatchable kill, the xterms
are not killed.  This appears to be a bug in xterm itself.

Send/expect sequences can be done in multixterm command files.
However, due to the richness of the possibilities, to document
it properly would take more time than the author has at present.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
Requires Expect 5.36.0 or later.
.br
Requires Tk 8.3.3 or later.

.SH VERSION
This man page describes version 1.8 of multixterm.

The latest version of multixterm is available from
http://expect.nist.gov/example/multixterm . However, if your version
of Expect and Tk are too old (see REQUIREMENTS above) you should
download a new version of expect from http://expect.nist.gov
