#!/usr/bin/expectk -f

# This is a CGI script to process requests created by the accompanying
# passwd.html form.  This script is pretty basic, although it is
# reasonably robust.  (Purposely intent users can make the script bomb
# by mocking up their own HTML form, however they can't expose or steal
# passwords or otherwise open any security holes.)  This script doesn't
# need any special permissions.  The usual (ownership nobody) is fine.
#
# With a little more code, the script can do much more exotic things -
# for example, you could have the script:
#
# - telnet to another host first (useful if you run CGI scripts on a
#   firewall), or
#
# - change passwords on multiple password server hosts, or
# 
# - verify that passwords aren't in the dictionary, or
# 
# - verify that passwords are at least 8 chars long and have at least 2
#   digits, 2 uppercase, 2 lowercase, or whatever restrictions you like,
#   or
#
# - allow short passwords by responding appropriately to passwd
#
# and so on.  Have fun!
