I hereby disclaim all responsibility for this hack. If it backfires on
you in any way whatsoever, that's the breaks. Not my fault. If you
don't understand the risks inherent in doing this, don't do it. If you
use this hack and it allows vicious vandals to break into your
company's computers and costs you your job and your company millions
of dollars, well that's just tough nuggies. Don't come crying to me.
