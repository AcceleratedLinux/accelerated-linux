* Version 3.0

Summary of user-visible changes since 2.0:

** Bug fixes and improved stability.

** Long options work on all platforms.

   The GNU libc getopt_long() functions were copied into the httptunnel
   distribution and is used on systems where no long options are available
   in the standard libraries.

** Logging messages get a time stamp.

** httptunnel is now Debianized.

** Replaced the MANUAL file with two man pages.

** Made compatible with the Univeral TUN device driver.

** New --strict-content-length option.

   This option makes httptunnel obey the Content-Length field in the
   HTTP header.  This improves compatibility with some proxies.  The
   defalt is to be sloppy about the Content-Length field.

** New --keep-alive option.

   With this option, httptunnel will send keep-alive bytes, which
   improves stability with some proxies.  The defailt is to send
   keep-alive bytes every five seconds.

** New --max-connection-age option.

   This option specifies the maximum age of any HTTP connection made
   by httptunnel.  The default is 300 seconds.

** New --proxy-authorization option.

   This option is used to send a authorization string to the proxy.

** New --proxy-authorization-file option.

   This option works as --proxy-authorization, only it reads the
   string from the specified file.

** New --pid-file option.

   With this option, httptunnel will write its process identification
   number to the specified file.

** New --user-agent option.

   Use this option to specify a string for the User-Agent field sent
   in HTTP headers.  This is useful for proxies that want a specific
   value there.

* Version 2.0

Summary of user-visible changes since 1.0:

** There is a FAQ.

** There is a MANUAL which isn't.

** Port numbers have default values.

** There is a debug mode.

   Using --enable-debug with 'configure' will make htc and hts recognize
   --debug and --logfile options.

** Uses syslog.

   When not in debug mode, important events and unexpected errors
   are logged using LOG_NOTICE and LOG_ERROR, respectively.

** hts takes a --content-length option.

   It works like the one for htc.

** Short option for --forward-port changed from -f to -F.

** Improved portability.

   Works on at least some versions of GNU/Linux, Solaris, AIX,
   Digital UNIX, Cygwin, FreeBSD, OpenBSD.

** Improved protocol and HTTP handling.

   Resulting in better stability.

** Bug fixes.

** Bug reports should now go to bug-httptunnel@nocrew.org.

* Version 1.103

** Bug reporting email addres changed to bug-httptunnel@gnu.org.

** Miscellaneous cosmetic stuff.

* Version 1.102

** Emulate endprotoent() if not present.

** Changed email addresses to preferred ones.

** Handle setsockopt() errors slightly more gracefully.

* Version 1.101

** Disabled compilation of tt and rw, as they are hardly needed anymore.

** Changed internal parameters once again.

   Send keep-alive bytes ever 5 seconds.

   Maximum connection time back to 5 minutes.

** Improved logging.

   Write package name, package version and debug level to log.

   Removed one superfluous level of indentation.

** Removed a problem which caused a busy loop.

   This only happened when --proxy-buffer-* was active.

* Version 1.100

** Removed an attempt to printf() NULL, which caused a crash on Solaris.

   Thanks to Tomas Berndtsson <tomas@nocrew.org> for the fix.

** Hopefully the setsockopt() errors will be gone.

** Changed some internal parameters to satisfy really picky proxies.

   Increased frequency of keep-alive bytes from 1/30s to 1/10s.

   Decreased maximum connection time from 5 minutes to 1 minute.

   TODO: user interface for these parameters.

* Version 1.99

** Added plea for post cards to README.

   The greedy author tries to turn this otherwise perfectly free
   software into a vehicle for extracting post cards from innocent
   users.

** Fixed --enable-debug without --debug bug.

** Adjusted debugging levels.

   0 now means no debugging messages, 5 is the highest level.

* Version 1.98

** Close a HTTP POST connection after 5 minutes.

   This is a kludge, but finally no data is lost with Squid 2.

** httptunnel is now GNU software.

** Changed the short option for --forward-port from -f to -F.

   Because I want to use -f for a future --file option.

** Removed some possible buffer overflows.

* Version 1.97

** Improved poll() emulation.

** Improved HTTP request and response parsing.

** hts --content-length works now.

   Thanks Philip!

** Try some setsockopt() settings to make connections more reliable.

* Version 1.96

** Changed compiler warnings when --enable-debug.

** Included the HTTP RFCs in the distribution.

** Emulate poll() using select() on systems without poll().

   Still untested, though.

** Fixed void * arithmetic and a prototype/definition mismatch.

   Thanks to Larry Gensch for this patch!

* Version 1.95

** I/O byte counters.

   --debug 3 will show byte counters for the data sent and recieived.
   --debug 4 will also show byte counters for the raw protocol data
   sent and received.

** hts takes a --content-length switch.

** Make sure HTTP GET responses are not cached.

   Added "Expires: 0" (invalid HTTP, I know) and "Cache-Control:
   no-store, must-revalidate" to HTTP GET response header.

* Version 1.94

** Avoid a few compilation warnings.

** http.h didn't make it into the distribution.

* Version 1.93

** Parse HTTP GET responses.

   If the version is unknown or the status code signals an error, fail.

* Version 1.92

** Forgot to regenerate configure, Makefile, etc.

* Version 1.91

** Forgot to update NEWS before releasing 1.90.

* Version 1.90

** More robust.

** Major protocol change.

   Now uses the protocol for HTTP GET requests too.

** Improved error logging.

** Solaris and AIX fixes.

   Thanks to Andrew Gray for the patch.

** Send keep-alive bytes every 30 seconds of inactivity.

* Version 1.5

** New --logfile switch.

** Uses syslog.

* Version 1.4

** Works with Squid 2.

** Solaris fixed.

   And this time, they're actually tested!  Thanks to Tomas Berndtsson
   for supplying these fixes.

* Version 1.3

** Fixes for addr_inet() and systems without getopt_long().

   Thanks to sgback@nety.yeungnam.ac.kr for the bug report.

* Version 1.2

** 'configure' checks whether socklen_t is declared or not.

   This should make httptunnel compile on older libc's.
   Thanks to Tomas Almlof and J A for reporting this bug.

** Not specifying a proxy doesn't give a usage error any more.

   Thanks to George Bonser for reporting this bug.

* Version 1.1

** 'configure' takes a --enable-debug switch.

   Use it to enable debugging code.

** 'htc' and 'hts' take a --debug switch.

   Use it to enable debugging mode.

** Some arguments on the command line of 'hts' and 'htc' don't need to
   be specified with port numbers.

   If unspecified, a default port number is used.  Use --help to see
   where this applies.

** Removed annoying buffering bug.

   So no fake --proxy-buffer-size and --proxy-buffer-timeout is needed
   any more.

* Version 1.0

** First public release.
