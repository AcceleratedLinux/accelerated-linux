httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data path tunnelled in HTTP
requests.  The requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired.

This can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls.  If WWW
access is allowed through an HTTP proxy, it's possible to use
httptunnel and, say, telnet or PPP to connect to a computer outside
the firewall.

If you still don't understand what this is all about, maybe you
can find some useful information in the FAQ file.

This program is mostly intended for technically oriented users.
They should know what to do.

httptunnel is free software.  See COPYING for terms and conditions.

Information and/or latest release should be available from these places:
	http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html

	ftp://ftp.nocrew.org/pub/nocrew/unix

I take no responsibility for what you do with this software.  It has
the potential to do dangerous things, like disabling the protection
you system administrator has set up for the local network.  Read the
DISCLAIMER file.

There are two programs: hts and htc.  hts is the httptunnel server
and htc is the client.  hts should be installed on a computer outside
the HTTP proxy, and htc should be installed on your local computer.

Documentation about how to use the programs should be searched in this
order:
	source code
	--help output
        FAQ
	README

Having said that, here's a (probably outdated) example:
	At host REMOTE, start hts like this:
		hts -F localhost:23 8888
	At host LOCAL, start htc like this:
		htc -F 2323 -P PROXY:8000 REMOTE:8888
	or, if using a buffering HTTP proxy:
		htc -F 2323 -P PROXY:8000 -B 48K REMOTE:8888

	Now you can do this at host LOCAL:
		telnet localhost 2323
	and you will hopefully get a login prompt from host REMOTE.
