This is a set of shell scripts for testing Ethernet bridging.

mkbr makes a simple bridge and clones the ip address.
rmbr removes bridge

The functional test needs two ethernets (eth0, eth1,
and the dummy network device. It may screw up your route
table. Also, it leaves eth0 in an bad state if test fails.

The stresstest needs two ethernets (eth0 and eth1).
For highest stress, traffic should be sent over the bridge
while the test is ongoing.  The goal is to exercise, races
that occur when traffic is flowing while management operations occur.
