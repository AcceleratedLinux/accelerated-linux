Would be nice if:

- Add address learning limiting (hard limit at a fixed # of
  addresses? or maybe using rate markers?). There is a nasty DoS in
  here.

- Add fdb entry port # change limiting. For example: if one MAC
  address switches port more than once in the same second, there is
  something wrong (somebody trying to spoof?), so print a warning.

- Faster port state cycling; currently it takes 30 seconds for ports
  to cycle to the forwarding state.

- Detect port speed and adjust path cost accordingly?

- Use MII ioctls for detecting link beat lost quickly?

- Keep the IEEE 802.1d-mandated statistics (counters, mostly).

- Maybe integrate Kristian's GNOME frontend (see PROJECTS) once it
  stabilises. It looks nice.

- A cgi bridge configurer (a la Samba's SWAT, yummy....)
