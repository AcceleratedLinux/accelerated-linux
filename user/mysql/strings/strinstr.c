    Defines: strinstr()

    strinstr(src, pat) looks for an instance of pat in src.  pat is not a
    regex(3) pattern, it is a literal string which must be matched exactly.
    The result 0 if the pattern was not found else it is the start char of
    the pattern counted from the beginning of the string, where the first
    char is 1.
