# Test for 
# Bug #797: If a query is ignored on slave (replicate-ignore-table) the slave
# still checks that it has the same error as on the master.

source include/master-slave.inc;
connection master;
create table t1 (a int primary key);
# generate an error that goes to the binlog

insert into t1 values (1),(1);

# as the t1 table is ignored on the slave, the slave should be able to sync

# The port number is different when doing the release build with
# Do-compile, hence we have to replace the port number here accordingly
