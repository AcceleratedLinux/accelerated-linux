# Check that binlog is ok when a transaction mixes updates to InnoDB and

# It would be nice to make this a replication test, but in 4.0 the
# slave is always with --skip-innodb in the testsuite. I (Guilhem) however
# did some tests manually on a slave; tables are replicated fine and
# Exec_master_log_pos advances as expected.
