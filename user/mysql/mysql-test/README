This directory contains a test suite for mysql daemon. To run
the currently existing test cases, simply execute ./mysql-test-run in
this directory. It will fire up the newly built mysqld and test it.
Note that you do not have to have to do make install, and you could
actually have a co-existing MySQL installation - the tests will not
conflict with it.

All tests must pass. If one or more of them fail on your system, please
read the following manual section of how to report the problem:

http://www.mysql.com/doc/M/y/MySQL_test_suite.html


You can create your own test cases. To create a test case:

 cd t
 vi test_case_name.test

 in the file, put a set of SQL commands that will create some tables,
 load test data, run some queries to manipulate it.

 We would appreciate if the test tables were called t1, t2, t3 ... (to not
 conflict too much with existing tables).

 Your test should begin by dropping the tables you are going to create and
 end by dropping them again.  This will ensure that one can run the test
 over and over again.
 
 If you are using mysqltest commands (like result file names) in your
 test case you should do create the result file as follows:

 mysql-test-run --record test_case_name

 or

 mysqltest --record < t/test_case_name.test

 If you only have a simple test cases consistent of SQL commands and comments
 you can create the test case one of the following ways:

 mysql-test-run --record test_case_name

 mysql test < t/test_case_name.test > r/test_case_name.result

 mysqltest --record --record-file=r/test_case_name.result < t/test_case_name.test

 When this is done, take a look at r/test_case_name.result
 - If the result is wrong, you have found a bug;  In this case you should
   edit the test result to the correct results so that we can verify
   that the bug is corrected in future releases.

To submit your test case, put your .test file and .result file(s) into
a tar.gz archive, add a README that explains the problem, ftp the 
archive to ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/ and send  a mail
to bugs@lists.mysql.com
