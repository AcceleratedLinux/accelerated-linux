%description
This package includes the shared libraries for both MySQL %{version3} and
MySQL %{version4}. Install this package instead of "MySQL-shared", if you 
have applications installed that are dynamically linked against MySQL
3.23.xx but you want to upgrade to MySQL 4.0.xx without breaking the library
dependencies.
