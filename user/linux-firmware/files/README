Extra firmware directory
-------------------------
Any firmware that doesn't currently exist in linux-firmware can be stored
in this directory. An explanation of the firmware used should be added to
this file so that it can be modified/removed in the future.

QCA6174
-------
Wireless drivers used by the ath10k driver. The original files were taken
from Isaac Hermida's branch DAL-1465_ath10_sdio, as generated by Javier
Viguera. An adition to the board-2.bin file was made to allow a generic
version of the board - which had no variant information. It was added
using the qca-swiss-army-knife utility ath10k-bdencoder from the source:

https://github.com/qca/qca-swiss-army-knife.git

We now support boards:
bus=sdio,vendor=0271,device=050a,subsystem-vendor=0000,subsystem-device=0000
bus=sdio,vendor=0271,device=050a,subsystem-vendor=0000,subsystem-device=0000,variant=US.bin
bus=sdio,vendor=0271,device=050a,subsystem-vendor=0000,subsystem-device=0000,variant=WW.bin

QCA9984
-------
Wireless firmware used by the ath10k driver for QCA9984 chipset on TX64.

To support up to 128 stations, the firmware MUST be a trimmed version (as noted in the
following links as the "diet" version). The board-2-ct.bin and firmware-5-ct-community.bin
are downloaded from:

https://www.candelatech.com/downloads/ath10k-9984-10-4/board-2-ct.bin
https://www.candelatech.com/downloads/ath10k-9984-10-4b/ath10k-fw-beta/

Note:
1. No CT-HTT-MGT feature. Swbmiss, beacon filtering, roaming code, descriptor-mgt
is compiled out.

2. The community version may be used for any purpose allowed by the official firmware
from Qualcom-Atheros, including commercial applications.

3. hw.h of ath10k driver is changed to support up to 128 stations, and the change
should not affect QCA988X chipset.

4. CDRouter tests shows that it's stable and performance is comparable with the
upstream driver.
