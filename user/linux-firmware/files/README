Extra firmware directory
-------------------------
Any firmware that doesn't currently exist in linux-firmware can be stored
in this directory. An explanation of the firmware used should be added to
this file so that it can be modified/removed in the future.

QCA6174
-------
Wireless drivers used by the ath10k driver. The original files were taken
from Isaac Hermida's branch DAL-1465_ath10_sdio, as generated by Javier
Viguera. An adition to the board-2.bin file was made to allow a generic
version of the board - which had no variant information. It was added
using the qca-swiss-army-knife utility ath10k-bdencoder from the source:

https://github.com/qca/qca-swiss-army-knife.git

We now support boards:
bus=sdio,vendor=0271,device=050a,subsystem-vendor=0000,subsystem-device=0000
bus=sdio,vendor=0271,device=050a,subsystem-vendor=0000,subsystem-device=0000,variant=US.bin
bus=sdio,vendor=0271,device=050a,subsystem-vendor=0000,subsystem-device=0000,variant=WW.bin
