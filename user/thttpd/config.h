/* CONFIGURE: CGI programs must match this pattern to get executed.  It's
** a simple shell-style wildcard pattern, with * meaning any string not
** containing a slash, ** meaning any string at all, and ? meaning any
** single character; or multiple such patterns separated by |.  The
** patterns get checked against the filename part of the incoming URL.
**
** Restricting CGI programs to a single directory lets the site administrator
** review them for security holes, and is strongly recommended.  If there
** are individual users that you trust, you can enable their directories too.
**
** You can also specify a CGI pattern on the command line, with the -c flag.
** Such a pattern overrides this compiled-in default.
**
** If no CGI pattern is specified, neither here nor on the command line,
** then CGI programs cannot be run at all.  If you want to disable CGI
** as a security measure that's how you do it, just don't define any
** pattern here and don't run with the -c flag.

** probably a really bad idea.

** If this many are already running, then attempts to run more will

** user's home directory.  thttpd provides two options for mapping
** this construct to an actual filename.
**
** 1) Map ~username to <prefix>/username.  This is the recommended choice.
** Each user gets a subdirectory in the main chrootable web tree, and
** the tilde construct points there.  The prefix could be something
** like "users", or it could be empty.  See also the makeweb program
** for letting users create their own web subdirectories.
**
** 2) Map ~username to <user's homedir>/<postfix>.  The postfix would be
** the name of a subdirectory off of the user's actual home dir, something
** like "public_html".  This is what Apache and other servers do.  The problem
** is, you can't do this and chroot() at the same time, so it's inherently
** a security hole.  This is strongly dis-recommended, but it's here because
** some people really want it.  Use at your own risk.
**
** You can also leave both options undefined, and thttpd will not do
** anything special about tildes.  Enabling both options is an error.

**
** Alternately, if you want to run the same thttpd binary on multiple
** machines, and want to build in alternate names for some or all of
** them, you can define a list of canonical name to altername name
** mappings.  thttpd seatches the list and when it finds a match on
** the canonical name, that alternate name gets used.  If no match
** is found, the canonical name gets used.
**
** If both SERVER_NAME and SERVER_NAME_LIST are defined here, thttpd searches
** the list as above, and if no match is found then SERVER_NAME gets used.

** where if there are a whole lot of items in a directory then name lookup
** becomes very slow.  This feature makes thttpd use subdirectories
** based on the first characters of each hostname.  You can set it to use
** from one to three characters.  If the hostname starts with "www.", that
** part is skipped over.  Dots are also skipped over, and if the name isn't
** long enough then "_"s are used.  Here are some examples of how hostnames
** would get turned into directory paths, for each different setting:
** 1: www.acme.com ->    a/www.acme.com
** 1: foobar.acme.com -> f/foobar.acme.com

** 3: m.tv ->            m/t/v/m.tv
** 4: m.tv ->            m/t/v/_/m.tv
** Note that if you compile this setting in but then forget to set up
** the corresponding subdirectories, the only error indication you'll
** get is a "404 Not Found" when you try to visit a site.  So be careful.
