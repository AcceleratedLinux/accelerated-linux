From: MATSUURA Takanori <t-matsuu@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp>

Even now, it is used clock-1.1 based source on Linux for PowerPC
architecture, attached on this mail.

Please merge this source in main util-linux source.

But I'm not an author of this source, but Paul Mackerras.
http://linuxcare.com.au/paulus/
shows details of him.

/* V1.0
 * CMOS clock manipulation - Charles Hedrick, hedrick@cs.rutgers.edu, Apr 1992
 * 
 * clock [-u] -r  - read cmos clock
 * clock [-u] -w  - write cmos clock from system time
 * clock [-u] -s  - set system time from cmos clock
 * clock [-u] -a  - set system time from cmos clock, adjust the time to
 *                  correct for systematic error, and put it back to the cmos.
 *  -u indicates cmos clock is kept in universal time
 *
 * The program is designed to run setuid, since we need to be able to
 * write to the CUDA.
 *
 *********************
 * V1.1
 * Modified for clock adjustments - Rob Hooft, hooft@chem.ruu.nl, Nov 1992
 * Also moved error messages to stderr. The program now uses getopt.
 * Changed some exit codes. Made 'gcc 2.3 -Wall' happy.
 *
 * I think a small explanation of the adjustment routine should be given
 * here. The problem with my machine is that its CMOS clock is 10 seconds 
 * per day slow. With this version of clock.c, and my '/etc/rc.local' 
 * reading '/etc/clock -au' instead of '/etc/clock -u -s', this error 
 * is automatically corrected at every boot. 
 *
 * To do this job, the program reads and writes the file '/etc/adjtime' 
 * to determine the correction, and to save its data. In this file are 
 * three numbers: 
 *
 * 1) the correction in seconds per day (So if your clock runs 5 
 *    seconds per day fast, the first number should read -5.0)
 * 2) the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 the last time the program was
 *    used.
 * 3) the remaining part of a second which was leftover after the last 
 *    adjustment
 *
 * Installation and use of this program:
 *
 * a) create a file '/etc/adjtime' containing as the first and only line:
 *    '0.0 0 0.0'
 * b) run 'clock -au' or 'clock -a', depending on whether your cmos is in
 *    universal or local time. This updates the second number.
 * c) set your system time using the 'date' command.
 * d) update your cmos time using 'clock -wu' or 'clock -w'
 * e) replace the first number in /etc/adjtime by your correction.
 * f) put the command 'clock -au' or 'clock -a' in your '/etc/rc.local'
 *
 * If the adjustment doesn't work for you, try contacting me by E-mail.
 *
 ******
 * V1.2
 *
 * Applied patches by Harald Koenig (koenig@nova.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de)
 * Patched and indented by Rob Hooft (hooft@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE)
 * 
 * A free quote from a MAIL-message (with spelling corrections):
 *
 * "I found the explanation and solution for the CMOS reading 0xff problem
 *  in the 0.99pl13c (ALPHA) kernel: the RTC goes offline for a small amount
 *  of time for updating. Solution is included in the kernel source 
 *  (linux/kernel/time.c)."
 *
 * "I modified clock.c to fix this problem and added an option (now default,
 *  look for USE_INLINE_ASM_IO) that I/O instructions are used as inline
 *  code and not via /dev/port (still possible via #undef ...)."
 *
 * With the new code, which is partially taken from the kernel sources, 
 * the CMOS clock handling looks much more "official".
 * Thanks Harald (and Torsten for the kernel code)!
 *
 ******
 * V1.3
 * Canges from alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au (Alan Modra):
 * a) Fix a few typos in comments and remove reference to making
 *    clock -u a cron job.  The kernel adjusts cmos time every 11
 *    minutes - see kernel/sched.c and kernel/time.c set_rtc_mmss().
 *    This means we should really have a cron job updating
 *    /etc/adjtime every 11 mins (set last_time to the current time
 *    and not_adjusted to ???).
 * b) Swapped arguments of outb() to agree with asm/io.h macro of the
 *    same name.  Use outb() from asm/io.h as it's slightly better.
 * c) Changed CMOS_READ and CMOS_WRITE to inline functions.  Inserted
 *    cli()..sti() pairs in appropriate places to prevent possible
 *    errors, and changed ioperm() call to iopl() to allow cli.
 * d) Moved some variables around to localise them a bit.
 * e) Fixed bug with clock -ua or clock -us that cleared environment
 *    variable TZ.  This fix also cured the annoying display of bogus
 *    day of week on a number of machines. (Use mktime(), ctime()
 *    rather than asctime() )
 * f) Use settimeofday() rather than stime().  This one is important
 *    as it sets the kernel's timezone offset, which is returned by
 *    gettimeofday(), and used for display of MSDOS and OS2 file
 *    times.
 * g) faith@cs.unc.edu added -D flag for debugging
 *
 * V1.4: alan@SPRI.Levels.UniSA.Edu.Au (Alan Modra)
 *       Wed Feb  8 12:29:08 1995, fix for years > 2000.
 *       faith@cs.unc.edu added -v option to print version.
 *
 * August 1996 Tom Dyas (tdyas@eden.rutgers.edu)
 *       Converted to be compatible with the SPARC /dev/rtc driver.
