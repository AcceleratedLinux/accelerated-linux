I want to spend two words about hping2 developing model.
Hping2 is totally open to new contribution and ideas,
if you have even the littlest idea in order to make
hping better or you make some patch send me an email.
All the patches, if they don't break the old code and
are not totally useless, will be included. I know of
a lot of projects that are GPLed but in some way "close"
since every new patch is considered bloat or the only
possible code is the primary authors code: THIS IS
NOT THE CASE! Also every the littlest doc contribution
will be added to hping2, you can just build a plain-text
file that exposes how to do some task with hping, it will
be included under the 'docs' directory.
