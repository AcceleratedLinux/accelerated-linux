\fB\-\-detect\-structured[=yes/no(*)]\fR
Use the DLP (Data Loss Prevention) module to detect SSN and Credit Card numbers inside documents/text files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-structured\-ssn\-format=X\fR

\fB\-\-scan\-mail[=yes(*)/no]\fR
Scan mail files.

Use the url-based heuristic phishing detection (Phishing.Heuristics.Email.*)
.TP
\fB\-\-heuristic\-scan\-precedence[=yes/no(*)]\fR
Allow heuristic match to take precedence. When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected  virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first,  the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
.TP
\fB\-\-phishing\-ssl[=yes/no(*)]\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-scan\-pe[=yes(*)/no]\fR
PE stands for Portable Executable \- it's an executable file format used in all 32\-bit versions of Windows operating systems. By default ClamAV performs deeper analysis of executable files and attempts to decompress popular executable packers such as UPX, Petite, and FSG.
