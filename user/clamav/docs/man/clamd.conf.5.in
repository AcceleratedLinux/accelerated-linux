\fBPhishingAlwaysBlockSSLMismatch BOOL\fR
Always block SSL mismatches in URLs, even if the URL isn't in the database. This can lead to false positives.

If an archive contains both a heuristically detected virus/phishing, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported. Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first, the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
