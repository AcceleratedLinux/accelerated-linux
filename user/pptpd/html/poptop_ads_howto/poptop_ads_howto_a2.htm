<p><strong>A3. Samba for Fedora Core 4<br>
  </strong>(last update: 6 March 2006)</p>
<p>FC4 comes with samba v3.0.14a. The samba project released v3.0.20 on 20 August 2005. Here is a quote from the v3.0.20 release note about winbind.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>-- quote --<br>
    Winbindd has been completely rewritten in this release to support
an almost completely non-blocking, asynchronous request/reply
model.  This means that winbindd will scale much better in 
large domain environments and on high latency networks.<br>
-- quote --
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is highly recommended to upgrade samba to v3.0.20 or above. The latest samba v3.0.21c rpms for FC4 can be found in <a href="http://us5.samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/Fedora/RPMS/i386/core/4/">here</a>. Download a copy and then update samba with command &quot;rpm -Uvh samba*.rpm&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>
Samba v3.0.21 has a bug on the oplock code. Avoid this version. Use v3.0.21a or above. </p>

<a name="fc4freeradius"></a><strong>A4. Software for Radius Setup on Fedora Core 4</strong><br>
(last update: 1 February 2006)
<p>In additional to the software we installed in the previous sections, we need two more. Freeradius is one of them. FC4 comes with freeradius-1.0.2-2 but it is broken. At the time of writing, the latest one is freeradius-1.0.4-1.FC4.1. Get it from <em>yum</em> as it has quite a few dependences. <em>yum</em> will resolve all required dependences automagically.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[root@pptp ~]# yum install freeradius</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The second software you will need is radiusclient. Get the FC4 rpm, radiusclient-0.3.2-0.2.fc4.rf.i386.rpm, from <a href="http://rpmforge.net/user/packages/radiusclient/">RPMforge</a>. Install it with &quot;rpm -ivh&quot;.</p>
