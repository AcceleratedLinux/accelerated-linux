*** WHAT'S GOING ON? ***

These are patterns (protocol definitions) for the Linux layer 7 packet 
classifier (l7-filter).  To use them, you need the kernel and iptables 
patches (or l7-filter userspace version) available at 
http://sf.net/projects/l7-filter/ .  See the HOWTOs.

To install these patterns into their default location, say "make install".

For a nice way to view these patterns: http://l7-filter.sf.net/protocols
 
More information on the patterns can be found at http://protocolinfo.org
This wiki is intended to make it easy for the community to pool its
knowledge of how to identify network protocols.


*** WHAT'S IN HERE? ***

The patterns in the "protocols" directory are the mainstream ones.  They 
match protocols like HTTP, FTP, eDonkey2000, Kazaa, and so on.

"extra" is for patterns of less general interest.

"malware" contains patterns for viruses and worms.  

"file_types" contains patterns for file types.

"testing" contains programs for testing the speed & accuracy of the patterns.


*** CAN I HELP? ***

Please report your experience with these patterns at http://protocolinfo.org
Or you can write to: l7-filter-developers@lists.sf.net .  (You must subscribe at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/l7-filter-developers to post.)

You can also e-mail Matthew Strait directly at quadong AT users.sf.net

Please note that many of these patterns were NOT written by experts.  So
if you think a pattern is broken and you know better, you may be right!
