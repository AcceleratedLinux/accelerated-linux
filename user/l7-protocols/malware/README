The patterns here now (Code Red, Nimda) are only for proof-of-concept. 
To usefully control the spread of a new worm through bandwidth
arbitration, it will be necessary for new patterns to be written quickly
in response to the new worm.  Also the patterns must be more flexible
than the ones presented here, as these only use simple string matching, 
which would be easily defeated by any reasonably clever worm.
