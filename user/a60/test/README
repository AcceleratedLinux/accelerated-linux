	test/README:					sep '90



The test suite for the NASE A60 Algol 60 interpreter.


The *.a60 files are the source, the *.outp files are the corresponding
output.


runtest.sh   -  is the un*x shell-script, running the tests and
		comparing the result with the expected output.

and these are dumb versions:

runtest.bat  -	for msdos.

runtest.g    -	for atari with the gulam shell.

runtest.ex   -	for the amiga to execute.


Maybe there will be differences in the precision of 'real' numbers. At
least, the output should be similar to the example output.
