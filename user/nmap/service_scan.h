 * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derived works", yet *
 * it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid       *
 * misunderstandings, we consider an application to constitute a           *
 * "derivative work" for the purpose of this license if it does any of the *
 * following:                                                              *
 * o Integrates source code from Nmap                                      *
 * o Reads or includes Nmap copyrighted data files, such as                *
 *   nmap-os-fingerprints or nmap-service-probes.                          *
 * o Executes Nmap and parses the results (as opposed to typical shell or  *
 *   execution-menu apps, which simply display raw Nmap output and so are  *
 *   not derivative works.)                                                * 
 * o Integrates/includes/aggregates Nmap into a proprietary executable     *

 * o Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above   *
 *                                                                         *
 * The term "Nmap" should be taken to also include any portions or derived *
 * works of Nmap.  This list is not exclusive, but is just meant to        *
 * clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common examples.  *
 * These restrictions only apply when you actually redistribute Nmap.  For *
 * example, nothing stops you from writing and selling a proprietary       *
 * front-end to Nmap.  Just distribute it by itself, and point people to   *
 * http://insecure.org/nmap/ to download Nmap.                             *
 *                                                                         *
 * We don't consider these to be added restrictions on top of the GPL, but *
 * just a clarification of how we interpret "derived works" as it applies  *
 * to our GPL-licensed Nmap product.  This is similar to the way Linus     *
 * Torvalds has announced his interpretation of how "derived works"        *
 * applies to Linux kernel modules.  Our interpretation refers only to     *
 * Nmap - we don't speak for any other GPL products.                       *
 *                                                                         *
 * If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using *
 * Nmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above,  *
 * we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary    *
 * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *
 * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *
 * as providing for priority support and updates as well as helping to     *
 * fund the continued development of Nmap technology.  Please email        *
 * sales@insecure.com for further information.                             *
 *                                                                         *
