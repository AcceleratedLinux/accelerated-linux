Nmap HACKING
------------

Information for potential Nmap hackers!

Source is provided to Nmap because we believe users have a
right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run
it.  This also allows you to audit the software for security holes
(none have been found so far).

Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,
and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes
to fyodor@insecure.org or nmap-dev@insecure.org for possible
incorporation into the main distribution.  By sending these changes to
Fyodor or one the insecure.org development mailing lists, it is
assumed that you are offering Fyodor the unlimited, non-exclusive
right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  This is important
because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating
problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).
Nmap will always be available Open Source.  If you wish to specify
special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you
send them.

Nmap is a community project and has already benefitted greatly from
outside contributors ( for examples, see the CHANGELOG or
http://www.insecure.org/nmap/#thanks ).  Bugfixes, and portability
changes will almost always be accepted.  Even if you do not have time
to track down and patch a problem, bug reports are always welcome.

Hackers interested in something more major, such as a new feature, are
encouraged to send a mail describing their plans to
nmap-dev@insecure.org .  This is a good way to solicit feedback on
your proposals.  List members are often very willing to help.  You
might want to subscribe to that mailing list as well -- send a blank
email to nmap-dev-subscribe@insecure.org .  While you are at it, you
might also want to subscribe to nmap-hackers via the same mechanism.
Web archives of those lists are at http://lists.insecure.org .

If you are not ready to send details of your feature to the whole
list, you can always start by mailing fyodor@insecure.org .

Some ideas of useful contributions/projects
-------------------------------------------

Of course, you are welcome to work on whatever suits your fancy.  But
here are some ideas of contributions that might be particularly
useful:

o Nmap GUI improvements -- I am currently maintaining NmapFE (also known
  as xnmap) -- the GTK GUI front end to Nmap.  I am very open to changes
  and improvements in that program.  If you have enhancement ideas, give
  it a shot!  Alternatively, consider contributing to the NmapGUI and
  UMIT projects available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nmapgui/
  and http://umit.sourceforge.net/ , respectively.

One of the best ways to help is to join the nmap-dev list
( http://cgi.insecure.org/mailman/listinfo/nmap-dev ).  Requests for
assistance and new Nmap-related projects are often posted there.

How to make code contributions
------------------------------

The preferred mechanism for submitted changes is unified diffs against
the latest development release version of Nmap.  Please send them to
fyodor@insecure.org or nmap-dev@insecure.org .  

To make a unified diff, please follow these instructions:

1. Remove temporary files:
    make clean

2. Rename your source tree:
    cd ..
    mv nmap-2.54BETA4 nmap-2.54BETA4-snazzy-feature

3. Unpack the original Nmap source alongside it:
    tar xzf nmap-2.54BETA4.tgz

4. Generate the diffs:
   diff -urNb nmap-2.54BETA4 nmap-2.54BETA4-snazzy-feature > nmap.patch

5. Check the patch and remove any unnecessary patches from the file.

6. If you've added several features, it's best to send them as
   several independent patches if you can.

If you have just patched one or two files, then making patches is even
easier. For each file, just do:

  cp file.c file.c.orig
  [Make changes to file.c ...]
  diff -u file.c.orig file.c > file.c.patch

and just send us the patch: file.c.patch.

I got the idea for this HACKING file from GNet 
(http://www.gnetlibrary.org/) and followed the
general structure of their HACKING file.
