Information for amd64 users
---------------------------

All releases of Squashfs prior to 2.0 generate incorrect
filesystems on amd64 machines.  Filesystems created on amd64 machines work
correctly on amd64 machines, but cannot be mounted on non-amd64 machines.
Likewise, filesystems created on non-amd64 machines cannot be mounted on amd64
machines.  This bug is caused by the different size of the "time_t" definition
used in SquashFS filesystem structures.

This bug is fixed in releases 2.0 and newer.  However, all amd64 filesystems
generated by previous releases will not be mountable on amd64 machines
with newer releases.  If you have amd64 filesystems generated with mksquashfs
version 2.0-alpha or older, it is important that you recreate the filesystem.
This can be performed by mounting the filesystem using a kernel with the
original patch (i.e. a 2.0-alpha or older patch) and running the NEW (i.e. this
release) mksquashfs tool to create a new SquashFS filesystem.
