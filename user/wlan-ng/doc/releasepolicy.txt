linux-wlan Release Policy/Checklist
--------------------------------------------------

[MSM Note: Here's a _quick_ attempt at a release policy for linux-wlan.
           It's very brief and relatively simple.  I'm open to suggestions
           for improvement.
]

The following steps should be taken each time a new release of linux-wlan
is ready for distribution:

0) Make sure the current code builds, loads, associates, and ftps 
   cleanly on all 3 AVS lab build boxes.
1) Assign an W.X.Y-preZ version number.
2) Update the version number in config.in.
3) Tag the files.
4) Build the tarball. (Bonehead! double check next time that the tarball
   and config.in version number match, eh?)
5) Release to ftp.
6) Announce on linux-wlan-annouce as a feature frozen 'pre' release.
7) Announce on freshmeat (Pavel? ;-)
8) Allow at least 24 hours for bug reports and (hopefully) bugfix patches.
9a) After 24 hour period, if bugfix patches and/or local fixes to bug 
    reports are present, apply patches and GOTO step 0.
9b) If no show-stopper bug-reports and/or patches are received during the
    'pre' release period GOTO step 10.
10) Make sure the current code builds, loads, associates, and ftps 
    cleanly on all 3 AVS lab build boxes.
11) Assign an W.X.Y version number.
12) Update the version number in config.in.
13) Tag the files.
14) Build the tarball. (Bonehead! double check next time that the tarball
    and config.in version number match, eh?)
15) Release to ftp.
16) Announce on linux-wlan-annouce as a final W.X.Y release.
17) Announce on freshmeat.
