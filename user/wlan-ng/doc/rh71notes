It may be useful for those using RH71.

Subject: [lwlan-user]: REDHAT 7.1 + wlan-ng 0.1.18 HOWTO

Hi all,

Just get the wlan-ng 0.1.18pre11 working on my redhat 7.1 and I would like 
to share the experiences with you.

Assumption:
         a default installation of redhat 7.1 with 
kernel-pcmcia-cs-3.1.24-2.rpm installed

Four steps as followings:

1) Get kernel source ready
install kernel-source-2.4.2-2 if you don't have the kernel source ready on 
the machine
copy a suitable configuration file from the configs directory to .config
make dep

2) Get pcmcia-cs header files ready
download the pcmcia-cs-3.1.24.tar.gz package
unzip it at appropriate place
make config
         when you were asked what kind of kernel configuration you want to 
use, select "1"
make all
DON'T "make install"

3) compile the wlan-ng-0.1.18pre11 code
download the linux-wlan-ng-0.1.18pre11.tar.gz
unzip it at appropriate place
make config
         select build-in kernel support
make all
make install

4) some minor configuration
edit /etc/pcmcia/config.opts to comment out the card definition for 
"Intersil PRISM2 11 .."
edit /etc/wlan-ng.opts
         change string p2RoamingMode to p2CnfRoamingMode
         set appropriate SSID for variable DesiredSSID
create an ifcfg-wlan0 file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

Ok, your machine should be able to work as a STA using 
wlan-ng-0.1.18pre11.  If you have experience with enabling AP mode, it 
shouldn't be a problem for you enable it in redhat 7.1

Regards,
Leonard Ye
