config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_XZ
	bool "Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .xz data"
	default y
	help
	  Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .xz data.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA
	bool "Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .lzma data"
	default y
	help
	  Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .lzma data.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_BZ2
	bool "Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .bz2 data"
	default y
	help
	  Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .bz2 data.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_GZ
	bool "Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .gz data"
	default y
	help
	  Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .gz data.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_Z
	bool "tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .Z data"
	default n
	help
	  Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .Z data.

config USER_BUSYBOX_AR
	bool "ar"
	default n  # needs to be improved to be able to replace binutils ar
	help
	  ar is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	  extract contents from archives. An archive is a single file holding
	  a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to
	  retrieve the original individual files (called archive members).
	  The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner,
	  and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
	  extraction.

	  The stored filename is limited to 15 characters. (for more information
	  see long filename support).
	  ar has 60 bytes of overheads for every stored file.

	  This implementation of ar can extract archives, it cannot create or
	  modify them.
	  On an x86 system, the ar applet adds about 1K.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires ar, you should
	  probably say N here.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_AR_LONG_FILENAMES
	bool "Support for long filenames (not needed for debs)"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_AR
	help
	  By default the ar format can only store the first 15 characters
	  of the filename, this option removes that limitation.
	  It supports the GNU ar long filename method which moves multiple long
	  filenames into a the data section of a new ar entry.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_AR_CREATE
	bool "Support archive creation"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_AR
	help
	  This enables archive creation (-c and -r) with busybox ar.

config USER_BUSYBOX_BUNZIP2
	bool "bunzip2"
	default y
	help
	  bunzip2 is a compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block
	  sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression
	  is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
	  conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the
	  performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires bunzip2, you
	  should probably say N here.

config USER_BUSYBOX_BZIP2
	bool "bzip2"
	default y
	help
	  bzip2 is a compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block
	  sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression
	  is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
	  conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the
	  performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires bzip2, you
	  should probably say N here.

config USER_BUSYBOX_CPIO
	bool "cpio"
	default y
	help
	  cpio is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	  extract contents from archives.
	  cpio has 110 bytes of overheads for every stored file.

	  This implementation of cpio can extract cpio archives created in the
	  "newc" or "crc" format, it cannot create or modify them.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires cpio, you
	  should probably say N here.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CPIO_O
	bool "Support for archive creation"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_CPIO
	help
	  This implementation of cpio can create cpio archives in the "newc"
	  format only.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CPIO_P

	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CPIO_O
	help

	default n
	select USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_GZ
	help
	  dpkg is a medium-level tool to install, build, remove and manage
	  Debian packages.

	  This implementation of dpkg has a number of limitations,
	  you should use the official dpkg if possible.

config USER_BUSYBOX_DPKG_DEB
	bool "dpkg_deb"
	default n
	select USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_GZ
	help
	  dpkg-deb unpacks and provides information about Debian archives.

	  This implementation of dpkg-deb cannot pack archives.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires dpkg-deb,
	  say N here.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_DPKG_DEB_EXTRACT_ONLY
	bool "Extract only (-x)"
	default n
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_DPKG_DEB
	help
	  This reduces dpkg-deb to the equivalent of
	  "ar -p <deb> data.tar.gz | tar -zx". However it saves space as none
	  of the extra dpkg-deb, ar or tar options are needed, they are linked
	  to internally.

config USER_BUSYBOX_GUNZIP
	bool "gunzip"
	default y
	help
	  gunzip is used to decompress archives created by gzip.
	  You can use the `-t' option to test the integrity of
	  an archive, without decompressing it.

config USER_BUSYBOX_GZIP
	bool "gzip"
	default y
	help
	  gzip is used to compress files.
	  It's probably the most widely used UNIX compression program.

	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_GZIP
	help
	  Enable big memory options for gzip.
	  0: small buffers, small hash-tables
	  1: larger buffers, larger hash-tables
	  2: larger buffers, largest hash-tables
	  Larger models may give slightly better compression

	bool "lzop compression levels 7,8,9 (not very useful)"
	default n
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_LZOP
	help
	  High levels (7,8,9) of lzop compression. These levels
	  are actually slower than gzip at equivalent compression ratios
	  and take up 3.2K of code.

	help
	  With this option tar can automatically detect compressed
	  tarballs. Currently it works only on files (not pipes etc).

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_TAR_FROM
	bool "Enable -X (exclude from) and -T (include from) options)"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_TAR

	default y
	help
	  unzip will list or extract files from a ZIP archive,
	  commonly found on DOS/WIN systems. The default behavior
	  (with no options) is to extract the archive into the
	  current directory. Use the `-d' option to extract to a
	  directory of your choice.
