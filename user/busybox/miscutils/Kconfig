	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_LESS_WINCH
	help
	  Makes less track window size changes.
	  If terminal size can't be retrieved and $LINES/$COLUMNS are not set,
	  this option makes less perform a last-ditch effort to find it:
	  position cursor to 999,999 and ask terminal to report real
	  cursor position using "ESC [ 6 n" escape sequence, then read stdin.

	  This is not clean but helps a lot on serial lines and such.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_LESS_DASHCMD
	bool "Enable flag changes ('-' command)"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_LESS

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_COMPRESS_BBCONFIG
	bool "Compress bbconfig data"
	default y
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_BBCONFIG
	help
	  Store bbconfig data in compressed form, uncompress them on-the-fly
	  before output.

	  If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	  bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	  be noticeable. Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	  and have very little memory, this might not be a win. Otherwise,
	  you probably want this.

config USER_BUSYBOX_BEEP

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHAT_NOFAIL
	bool "Enable NOFAIL expect strings"
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_CHAT
	default y
	help
	  When enabled expect strings which are started with a dash trigger
	  no-fail mode. That is when expectation is not met within timeout
	  the script is not terminated but sends next SEND string and waits
	  for next EXPECT string. This allows to compose far more flexible
	  scripts.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHAT_TTY_HIFI
	bool "Force STDIN to be a TTY"
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_CHAT
	default n

	  this on.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHAT_SEND_ESCAPES
	bool "Support weird SEND escapes"
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_CHAT
	default y
	help
	  Original chat uses some escape sequences in SEND arguments which
	  are not sent to device but rather performs special actions.
	  E.g. "\K" means to send a break sequence to device.
	  "\d" delays execution for a second, "\p" -- for a 1/100 of second.
	  Before turning this option on think twice: do you really need them?

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHAT_VAR_ABORT_LEN
	bool "Support variable-length ABORT conditions"
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_CHAT
	default y
	help
	  Original chat uses fixed 50-bytes length ABORT conditions. Say N here.

config USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHAT_CLR_ABORT
	bool "Support revoking of ABORT conditions"
	depends on USER_BUSYBOX_CHAT
	default y

	  /dev/loop0. If your /dev directory has normal names instead of
	  devfs names, you don't want this.

	  (in particular when a CPU bound process is running) it can
	  significantly speed up system startup.

	  As readahead(2) blocks until each file has been read, it is best to
