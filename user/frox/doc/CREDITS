Much of frox is written by me (James Hollingshead), but there are
pieces of code borrowed from other projects and patches contributed by
a number of other people. The bugs are mostly likely to be mine
though...

This file contains a list of other people who have contributed code.
There are many others who have sent bug reports, success reports
(always nice :) or other feedback - thanks to you also and keep them
coming.

Sorry if I've left you off this list - please contact me and I can
add you.
