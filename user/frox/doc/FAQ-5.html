<P>You can configure frox to run a virus scanner on downloaded
files between downloading them to the proxy and them being
forwarded to the client. You need to <CODE>./configure</CODE> with
<CODE>--enable-virus-scan</CODE>, and set the config file variable
VirusScanner to something like <CODE>'&quot;/usr/local/bin/yourviruscanner&quot;
&quot;--options&quot; &quot;%s&quot;'</CODE>. You no
longer need to be doing local caching for this to work - it
will work with caching through squid or with no caching at
all.</P>
<P>Note that the whole variable is enclosed in single quotes
('), while the individual arguments within are enclosed with
double quotes (&quot;). The <CODE>&quot;%s&quot;</CODE>
will be replaced by the name of the file to scan. NB. unlike
all the other paths in the config file, any pathnames or
filenames in VirusScanner will <EM>not</EM> be stripped in the
case that you are running in a chroot jail. If your virus
scanner exits with a value other than 0 when a file is scanned
and is virus free you will need to set VSOK to that value.</P>
<P>There are currently some problems with this:
<UL>
<LI>Only file downloads are scanned.</LI>
<LI>If the file contains a virus then the file will
not be sent to the user, even if your virus scanner is
able to clean the virus from the file.</LI>
<LI>The user will see a delay before the file starts
to download as the whole thing must be downloaded to
the proxy and be scanned before any of it can be
passed to the client.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If the <CODE>VSProgressMsgs</CODE> option is set to something
other than <CODE>0</CODE> then every time that number of seconds
passes during the delay a progress message will be sent to the
client. On the plus side these may be displayed to users of
command line ftp clients, and will probably prevent clients
from giving up and timing out. On the down side the progress
messages could confuse some ftp clients (I think they do with
some Mozilla builds).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc5.1">Can I redirect requests to a virus scanning http proxy?</A>
</H2>

<P>Probably not. Most of these proxies send various http progress
messages back to the client. Frox is unable to parse these without
giving it a more extensive http implementation, and so it will
probably fail. Also there will be a delay before the client starts
to get the file, and it may well time out during this period. There
is interest in being able to do this though, so if anyone wants to
try coding it then they are welcome.</P>
