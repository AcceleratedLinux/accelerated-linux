</H2>

<P>If you are running frox on a machine on your default route,
and with little or no firewalling between it and either the
outside world or your internal network you should not have
network problems. Because of the nature of the ftp protocol
though, if your setup is more complicated than this then you
may run into difficulties.</P>
<P>The easiest way of checking that your network setup isn't
what is causing the problems is to (temporarily if you wish)
run an ftp server on the machine which runs frox. If you can't
ftp from your clients to this server and retrieve files O.K. 
then your clients won't be able to ftp to frox either. Also
try running an ftp client on the frox machine and connecting
to a server in the outside world. If this doesn't work then
frox obviously won't be able to do this either.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc8.2">Control connection problems</A>
</H2>

<P>With a control connection problem your clients will not be
able to connect to ftp servers through frox at all. If
transparently proxying then check that
outgoing tcp traffic is being redirected to frox without
changing the destination address (ie. you must route it there,
not use DNAT), and that the machine running frox can make a
tcp connection to the outside world successfully</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc8.3">Data connection problems</A>
</H2>

<P>If the problem is with the data connection then your
clients will be able to connect to the ftp server, login, and
do things like print the current working directory. File
retrievals and directory listings will fail, though you may
find that passive mode ftp works and active doesn't, or visa
versa.</P>
<P>If you are having these problems I strongly reccomend that
you set <CODE>TransparentData</CODE> to <CODE>no</CODE>, and
<CODE>ApConv</CODE> to <CODE>yes</CODE> in the config file. The frox
machine must be able to make tcp connections on any port to
the outside world. It should also be possible to establish tcp
connections in either direction between the frox machine and
the client machines, and with no NAT being performed on these
connections. With this setup you shouldn't have any
problems.</P>
<P>The above suggestions aren't strictly necessary, but things
get more complicated without them.
<UL>
<LI><CODE>ApConv</CODE> = <CODE>no</CODE>: Either incoming tcp
connections must be allowed from the outside world to the
machine running frox, or they must be prevented only by a
NATed (IP masquerading) firewall which is configured to
allow ftp connections (eg. linux + ipt_nat_ftp.o
module)</LI>
<LI>If frox cannot make tcp connections to the client then
clients are limited to passive mode ftp.</LI>
<LI>If clients cannot make arbitrary tcp connections to
frox then they are limited to active mode ftp.</LI>
<LI>NAT between client and frox: If DNAT occurs when the
client connects to frox (ie. the client makes the connection
to a different IP to that which the packets frox eventually
receives are addressed to then you should set
<CODE>PASVAddress</CODE> to the IP which the clients should use. 
NB. This option doesn't actually exist yet, but let me know
if you need it and I'll consider adding it.</LI>
<LI><CODE>TransparentData</CODE> = <CODE>yes</CODE>: This can make
things really unpleasant. Are you <EM>sure</EM> you need
it? These are the problems which spring to mind...
<UL>
<LI>Frox should be in your default route for outgoing
tcp traffic. If you are using policy based routing to
route only port 21 tcp traffic to frox then
TransparentData will not work.</LI>
<LI>Beware that frox will make connections to your
clients that purport to be from arbitrary hosts outside
your network. If there is a firewall/router between your
frox and your clients with IP spoofing protection it must
let these packets through.</LI>
<LI>Have another read of SECURITY to remind yourself of
the extra risks you are taking.</LI>
