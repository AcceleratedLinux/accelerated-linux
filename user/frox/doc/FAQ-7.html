<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.1">I can't connect to an ftp site through frox?</A>
</H2>

<P>Look at the log file that frox produces and see if it gives
you any clues. It should say ``Connect from A to B''. If it
doesn't say anything then you aren't getting through to frox
at all - check the config file to see frox is listening on the
right address/interface. Have you remembered to do the
ipchains/iptables command that is in the INSTALL file?</P>
<P>If the log file suggests frox is connecting back to itself
then you are probably contacting it directly and
non-transparent proxying is switched off. Either switch
non-transparent proxying on in the config file, or make sure
that your ftp client is not trying to connect directly to frox
- either from you specifying the frox machine as the ftp host
on the command line, or from the client trying to use it
explicitly as a proxy.</P>
<P>If you have a complicated network setup then check the
<A HREF="FAQ-8.html#networking">Network Problems</A> section. </P>
<P>Read the 
<A HREF="FAQ-3.html#client-ref">client configuration</A>
section again</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.2">Frox says "unable to determine destination address"</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two likely causes for this. One is that you are
trying to do non-transparent proxying, but the config file is
not setup correctly. Ensure that <CODE>DoNTP</CODE> is set to
<CODE>yes</CODE> in the config file, and comment out
<CODE>NTPAddress</CODE> - it is never necessary and only serves
a purpose if you are doing a mixture of transparent and
non-transparent proxying.</P>
<P>The other possiblity is that your connection is
transparently redirected to frox, but frox is unable to
determine the orriginal destination. The most likely cause is
if you are using Linux kernel 2.4.x with ipchains
compatability. I do not know of a way around this short of
changing from ipchains to iptables (or changing back to a
2.2.x kernel!).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.3">Non transparent proxying won't work</A>
</H2>

<P>Check whether you have NTPAddress set. If this is set then
it must be set to the address and port that the ftp clients
are using to contact the proxy, otherwise clients will not be
offered non transparent proxying. If you unset it then all
clients will be offered non transparent proxying.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.4">Frox ignores the Squid proxy I am using</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have HTTP caching set up then frox should conduct
all anonymous downloads through your proxy. But, frox also
needs to make an ftp connection to the remote ftp server for
retrieving directory listings etc. Therefore if you do netstat
or equivalent you will not see a connection from frox to squid
unless a file download is actually in progress.</P>
<P>This also means that you cannot use frox + squid and then
firewall off ftp access to the outside world altogether. Your
best bet is to keep frox (with or without squid), and set
<CODE>ApConv</CODE> to <CODE>yes</CODE> in the config file. You will
still need to allow frox to make outbound tcp connections on
port 21, and any ports in the PasvPorts range, but you should
not have any of the usual problems associated with firewalling
ftp.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.5">HTTP caching doesn't work for a particular host</A>
</H2>

<P>With HTTP caching frox makes a connection to the ftp server
initially, and then the http proxy/cache makes its own connection
when you initiate a download. If the http proxy and frox are both
at the same IP address then there will be problems with any ftp
server (and there are a few) which only allow one connection per
host.</P>
<P>The workaround is not to use http caching! You can either do
this globally, or put in a specific config file subsection to
turn off caching for any hosts that you have this problem with.
A better workaround should appear in a future version.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.6">Non transparent proxy when usernames contain @</A>
</H2>

<P>As of version 0.7.8 frox scans the username from right to
left when looking for the dividing @. If your username on the
remote server is abc@def.org and you are logging in to
ftp.gnu.org you can simply give "abc@def.org@ftp.gnu.org" to
frox as your username.</P>
<P>If you are using both transparent and non-transparent
proxying then you will need to use the <CODE>NTPAddress</CODE>
option so that when your direct connection to ftp.gnu.org is
intercepted by frox it won't interpret your username
"abc@def.org" as a login to def.org with username abc.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.7">Audiogalaxy</A>
</H2>

<P>Audiogalaxy is a music sharing program. Although
audiogalaxy works through port 21 it does not use the ftp
protocol, and therefore frox does not allow its connections
through. If you are using frox as a transparent proxy and you
wish to use audiogalaxy then you need to change your
iptables/netfilter rules so that packets addressed to the
audiogalaxy servers do not pass through frox. Fortunately
audiogalaxy does not use port 21 to contact other machines
using the audiogalaxy client so these do not also need to be
added.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc7.8">I still can't get it to work</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a mailing list at <CODE>frox-user at lists.sourceforge.net</CODE>.
Please say what version of frox you are running, what
version of the linux kernel, whether you gave any options to
<CODE>./configure</CODE> at compile time, and what point exactly
it fails at. The log file should give you some info, especially if
you set LogLevel to 25.</P>
