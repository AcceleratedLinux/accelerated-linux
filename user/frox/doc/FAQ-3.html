<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc3.1">Configuring frox</A>
</H2>

<P>By default frox uses
<CODE>/usr/local/etc/frox.conf</CODE> as a configuration file, but
this can be changed either by giving
<CODE>--enable-configfile=/etc/whatever/you/want</CODE> to the
<CODE>./configure</CODE> script, or by the <CODE>-f</CODE> command line
option.</P>
<P>The sample config file is well commented and the best
documentation for configuration. Note you will need to edit
some of these options for it to work at all. You will also need
to create a working directory for frox - see below.</P>
<P>For the transparent proxying to work your kernel will need
to be compiled with transparent proxy support and you will need
to enable forwarding with ``<CODE>echo 1 &gt;&gt;
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</CODE>''. You then need to
redirect ftp requests passing through the box to frox. For
kernel 2.2 this will be something like ``<CODE>ipchains -A input
-p tcp -s LOCALNET -d 0/0 21 -j REDIRECT 2121</CODE>'', and for
kernel 2.4, ``<CODE>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -s
LOCALNET --dport 21 -j REDIRECT --to 2121</CODE>''.</P>
<P>You can configure frox to run from inetd with the FromInetd
option. This will not work well with either the local caching
or with TransparentData, but otherwise should be ok.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc3.2">The Working Directory</A>
</H2>

<P>Frox needs a working directory, specified in the config
file. This is used for temporary files and sockets, for
creating cache files in, and is also the directory frox will
chroot to. This directory should be owned by root,
permissions 0755, and frox will create the directory
structure it needs in here. If you are doing virus scanning
or using the command control program then these binaries,
with any libraries they need, must also be added to this
directory.</P>
<P>You may also have problems with resolving host names. 
Frox needs to resolve host names if you are using non
transparent proxying, or if you are doing caching with
CacheOnFQDN set to yes. There are two ways to fix this:</P>
<P>The quick and easy way is to define
<CODE>ResolvLoadHack</CODE> in the config file to an address
which is not defined in <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE>. Frox will try
and resolve this on startup and this will load the relevant
resolver libraries. It doesn't matter if this address fails
to resolve.</P>
<P>The other solution is to copy the resolver libraries into
the chroot jail. For me it works with <CODE>host.conf</CODE> and
<CODE>resolv.conf</CODE> in <CODE><EM>WorkingDir</EM>/etc/</CODE>,
and <CODE>libnss_dns.so.2</CODE> and <CODE>libresolv.so.2</CODE> in
<CODE><EM>WorkingDir</EM>/lib/</CODE> </P>
<H2><A NAME="client-ref"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc3.3">How should I configure my ftp clients?</A>
</H2>

<P>Normally you don't have to. Certainly don't set the ftp
proxy variable in your browser or set your ftp_proxy
environment variable to http://anything.</P>
<P>If you are using non-transparent ftp proxying (set
``DoNTP'' to ``yes'' in the config file) and you have a ftp
client which supports this (such as ncftp, or debian's apt-get
ftp method) then you need to set it up to login with
``username@host[:port]''. eg. ``anonymous@ftp.gnu.org'' or
``anonymous@ftp.gnu.org:21''. You can of course do this
manually by typing this in when prompted for the username.</P>
<P>You may have a mixture of clients being transparently
proxied and clients being non transparently proxied. In this
case if you set the NTPAddress to the address/port you have
told your non transparently proxied clients to contact the
proxy on then only they will see frox's login banner. Clients
which are transparently redirected to frox will see the login
banner of the remote host they are contacting and will not be
offered the chance to login with username@host:port.</P>
