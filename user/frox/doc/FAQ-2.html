<P>Compile frox with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ./configure
        make
        make install (as root)
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc2.1">./configure options</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>--enable-http-cache</CODE> and
<CODE>--enable-local-cache</CODE> compile in caching support. 
You can give both these options if you wish.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>--enable-virus-scan</CODE> compiles in support
for virus scanning downloaded files.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>--enable-configfile=...</CODE> allows you to set
the default config file to something else eg. 
/etc/frox.conf. Otherwise it defaults to
/usr/local/etc/frox.conf</LI>
<LI> <CODE>--enable-transparent-data</CODE> compiles in
support for transparently proxying the data connections. 
Note you probably don't need this. Transparent proxying
works without, and it entails security risks. If you wish
to run on a 2.4.x kernel you will also need
<CODE>--enable-libiptc</CODE></LI>

</H2>

<P>Frox was originally written for linux, but thanks to some
work by Sergey Matveychuk it should now run on BSD and
possibly some other UNIX like OSes. The configure script
should do things automatically for bsd systems, but there are
still one or two things you should be aware of.</P>
<P>The BSD transparent proxying code can use ipfilter or ipfw. 
ipfw is the default, but you can use the ipfilter code by
compiling with --enable-ipfilter. Other OSes which run ipfilter
may also work in this way. If you try it could you drop me an
email and let me know the result.</P>
<P>You need to have <CODE>Listen</CODE> defined to a local IP address
in your config file if you are doing transparent proxying. This
means that you can't listen on more than one interface.</P>
<P>You should also note that the TransparentData config file
option and the --enable-transparent-data compile time option
only works under linux. You probably don't need this
functionality anyway, but if you really do then feel free to
send me a patch. :)</P>
