Version 0.7.x

The config file has changed - earlier files will not be compatible.
There is a new mandatory config file option WorkingDir. This should
be a directory owned by root, permissions 0755. Frox chroots to
this dir by default - you should explicitly set "DontChroot" to "yes"
if you do not want this. The format of the caching options has also
changed. Finally frox now enforces running as a user other than root
unless this is overridden at compile time. The sample config file
documents the correct usage.

The format of the files in the local cache has changed. If you wish to
keep your old cache then you will need to run the script "cacheconv.pl".

The transparent proxying has reverted to working whatever host you connect
to. If you want to change that you can set the NTPDest config file option.

Additions include host specific subsections in the config file, and
options to pick the logging level, run from inetd, limit connections by
host, virus scan downloaded files (with an external program).

The main internal changes are the addition of some generic buffer
handling code (str.c), and completely rewritten config file parsing
code (now semi-automatically generated from a template).
