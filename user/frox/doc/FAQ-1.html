<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.1">What is frox?</A>
</H2>

<P>Frox is a transparent ftp proxy for linux written under
the GPL.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.2">What can it do for me?</A>
</H2>

<P>It will transparently proxy your ftp clients (duh). This
means that any clients you have that are behind the proxy will
believe that they are connecting to an ftp server as normal,
but will actually be connecting to frox. Frox will do the
onward connection to the remote server.</P>
<P>It can also be set up to do non-transparent proxying. In
this case the ftp client can connect directly to frox, but
instead of logging in with ``username'' should log in with
``username@ftp.wherever.org''.</P>
<P>On either of these sorts of connections it can do caching
of files you download, or converting of data connections from
active--&gt;passive which can make firewalling rules a lot
easier/safer. There is also basic support for running a virus
scanner on downloaded files. Frox can also encrypt connections
that it makes to ftp servers which support it.</P>
<P>These extra options can all be enabled/disabled at compile
time so if you don't want them you can still have a small
binary - the default one is around 30K.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.3">What can't it do for me?</A>
</H2>

<P>It does not implement ftp proxy over HTTP. This means if
you configure a web browser (eg. Netscape/Mozilla/IE) to use
frox as their ftp proxy it won't work. If you leave them with
ftp-proxy unconfigured then they should be transparently
proxied like anything else.</P>
<P>It cannot do transparent proxying on 2.4.x linux kernels
which are using ipchains compatability. I have not been able
to find out how to do this.</P>
<P>IPv6 is completely unimplemented</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.4">Why doesn't it run on ... OS</A>
</H2>

<P>Transparent proxy system calls vary a lot from system to
system. I only have success reports for linux and FreeBSD, but
you may well have success on any UNIX like OS which uses
ipfilter. See the section on 
<A HREF="FAQ-2.html#otheros">systems other than linux</A> for details and let me know if
you have success or failure</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.5">Where can I get it?</A>
</H2>

<P>Latest versions should be downloadable from the homepage
at: 
<A HREF="http://frox.sourceforge.net/">http://frox.sourceforge.net/</A> or at;
