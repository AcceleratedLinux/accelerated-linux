<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc4.1">HTTP caching vs local caching</A>
</H2>

<P>With HTTP caching frox rewrites ftp retrieve requests in
HTTP and sends them to a proxy server like squid which
actually retrieves the file and does the caching. With local
caching frox maintains its own cache of recently downloaded
files on the hard disk.</P>
<P>The main advantage of the HTTP method is that the cache can
be shared with any web browsers which use the same proxy
directly for their ftp requests. Local caching is much faster
(especially for small files) and lighter on network
resources.</P>
<P>Caching needs to be compiled in by running
<CODE>./configure</CODE> with <CODE>--enable-http-cache</CODE> or
<CODE>--enable-local-cache</CODE>. You can have both compiled in if
you want - the cache method actually used (if any) is chosen
in the config file.</P>
<P>For HTTP caching your config file needs to say:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        CacheModule HTTP
        HTTPProxy 192.168.2.1:3128 # proxy address
        # and optionally...
        MinCacheSize 64000 # in bytes
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Files smaller than MinCacheSize will not be cached. Latency
on small files can be really bad with this method since the
HTTP proxy has to make a separate connection to the ftp server
- setting MinCacheSize fairly high will help with this.</P>
<P>For Local caching your config file should say:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        CacheModule Local
        # and optionally...
        CacheSize 100 # in MB
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The cached copies will be created within frox's working directory
as specified in the config file. If CacheSize is unspecified the
cache will grow indefinitely.</P>
<P>Finally you can turn off caching with the line <CODE>CacheModule
None</CODE>. This is necessary if you wish a config file subsection to
not do caching when the parent section has it turned on.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc4.2">StrictCaching</A>
</H2>

<P>With strict caching off frox works out the URI for the file
it is retrieving by sending a PWD to ask the server what
the current working directory is. On a small minority of
servers this may be broken, and a server may return the same
answer to PWD for more than one directory. If additionally two
such directories contain files with the same names, sizes, and
times of modification then frox could cache the wrong file by
mistake.</P>
<P>StrictCaching tries to get around this by keeping track of
all directory changes and making up its own path instead of
asking the server for it. This has the disadvantage that ``cd
pub; get readme'' will not cache to the same file as ``get
pub/readme'' or ``get /pub/readme'' or ``cd /pub; get
readme''. As a result your cache hit rate will probably drop
considerably, but you will have the extra security. Note that
you can set this on a per server basis if there is a
particular server about which you are worried.</P>
<P>Thanks to Henrik Nordstrom for pointing this problem out
and suggesting a solution.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc4.3">CacheOnFQDN</A>
</H2>

<P>This option involves using FQDNs instead of IP addresses
for the cache requests (either to squid or the local cache),
and allowing squid to guess whether to
use binary or ascii file transfer rather than using the value
supplied by the ftp client. For transparently proxied
connections this requires a reverse DNS lookup to get the
FQDN, and may cause problems with un-synced mirrored ftp hosts
all running off the same FQDN, although most of the time there
will be no problems. The advantage is that you should increase
the hit rate, in particular with squid based caching for files
which have been previously downloaded through squid with a web
browser.</P>
<P>If all your clients are being non transparently proxied
then this option should cause no problems. Otherwise use with some care,
although it may be worth the extra hit rate.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc4.4">I get an ``Unable to initialise cache'' error.</A>
</H2>

<P>Check that frox was compiled with support for the cache
module you are attempting to use, and that you have given the
correct Cache options for that module. If doing http caching check
that the http proxy name resolves.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc4.5">I retrieved a file I had retrieved before and it doesn't seem to have been cached?</A>
</H2>

<P>Files are not cached if the ftp server doesn't support the
MDTM and SIZE extensions. Non-Anonymous ftp sessions are only
cached if you have set the <CODE>CacheAll</CODE> config file
option. Additionally if the host's DNS name resolves to more
than one IP address then the file will be cached, but frox has
no way of knowing that the different IP addresses refer to the
same host - unless your ftp client happens to pick the same IP
both times you will not get the cached file back. Using
CacheOnFQDN may impove this behaviour.</P>
