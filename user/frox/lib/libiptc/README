This is a copy of libiptc from iptables version 1.2 (ie. it isn't
written by me, and I don't necessarily understand it). It is under the
GPL. It contains a patch to prevent it from leaking file descriptors,
which should also now be found in upstream's CVS. This is not the most
recent version of libiptc, but more recent versions do not work on all
2.4.x linux kernels.

The built library is not installed, but linked statically to frox when
it is configured with --enable-transparent-data.
