Known and unfixed bugs. Any help appreciated. For those I have noted
that I can't reproduce please let me know if you hit them.

   o Transparent proxying doesn't work on 2.4.x kernels using ipchains
     compatability mode. Ipchains in 2.2.x or iptables in 2.4.x work fine.
     If anyone knows the correct invocation of getsockname/getsockopt to
     put in get_orig_dest() in this situation I'll fix it.
   
   o Sending SIGHUP doesn't re-read config file very nicely.
   o Aborting downloads doesn't always seem to work smoothly.
   o When run with -m0 (ie. MaxForks = 0) not all processes are killed 
     on exit.
   o If you are using transparent data proxying, and are also
     redirecting the destination of connections with FTPProxy or a CCP
     then passive ftp data connections will probably break.
   o If MaxTransferRate is enabled it affects all data transfers. This
     includes transfers to the client which are locally cached, and
     worst of all both the incoming and outgoing portions of the virus
     scanning.
