netflash-vm will extract a rootfs+kernel (FSK) image from the file or URL
and write it to local storage via /dev/flash/image before rebooting. It
performs some checks and can show a progress meter. It can also be run
in a CGI context for receiving firmware upgrades from a browser.

netflash-vm is intended to be a drop-in reimplementation of uClinux
netflash, but designed to handle complex firmware file encodings.
This was motivated by the desire to make firmware images as directly
bootable by virtual machine software as possile. netflash-vm can extract
firmware data from QCOW2 disk images read over a pipeline, yet maintain
compatibility with the original netflash command line arguments.
