	'ipv6 ospf6 passive' in INTERFACE NODE. 'prefix-list' which
	specifies the filter prefix for connected address prefix also
	moved to INTERFACE NODE as 'ipv6 ospf6 advertise prefix-list WORD'.
	The old obsoleted commands are still acceptable though. New command

	to advertise rather prefix than stub local-address even on loopback
	or pointopoint interfaces.

	did not care duplicate prefixes. fixed.

2001-09-07  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_message.c: There was a bug that prevent LSDB
	to syncronize. It was a DbDesc packet bug that Slave
	sends two different DbDesc packet on the same sequence
	number. This cause many LSAs are dropped when Exchanging
	LSDB, because the latter DbDesc packet that have the same
	sequence number will be ignored as duplicate packet.
	This seems to be exist at least before 0.9.4 version.
	Now this is the most stable candidate.

	* ospf6d.h: version 0.9.5a

2001-09-06  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_zebra.c ospf6_spf.c ospf6_lsa.c :
	delete nexthop check to certify the nexthop is Link-local address.
	Suppress Link-LSA origination on links other than Broadcast.
	SPF's nexthop calculation first checks linklocal address
	in Link-LSA, then checks source address of neighbor's packets.

	* ospf6_interface.c ospf6_ism.c ospf6_lsa.c ospf6_nsm.c:
	intra-area-prefix-lsa origination func moved to new one.

	* ospf6_interface.h ospf6d.[ch] ospf6_lsa.c: 
	interface_area_cmd now changed to have 'passive'
	and 'prefix-list' option.

	* ospf6_prefix.c:
	clean up.

2001-09-04  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	ospf6d was wrongly not calculate the prefix.
	this reported by (v6 16029) is fixed.

	* ospf6_neighbor.c: Instance of LSA Summary included
	in DbDesc packet was wrongly freed. The bug cause
	malformed DbDesc, ExChange <-> ExStart flapping,
	and then crash.

	* ospf6d.h: version 0.9.4

2001-08-21  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_route.[ch]: Showing format is changed.
	'show ipv6 route ospf6' -> 'show ipv6 ospf6 route'
	'show ipv6 route ospf6 external' ->
	'show ipv6 ospf6 route redistribute'

	* ospf6_lsdb.c ospf6_lsa.c ospf6_neighbor.c ospf6_interface.c:
	memory leak in LS list fixed.

	* all: clean up

	* ospf6d.h: version 0.9.3

2001-08-20  Kunihiro Ishiguro  <kunihiro@ipinfusion.com>

	* ospf6d.c (ospf6_timeval_sub_equal): Remove function.

	* ospf6_spf.c (ospf6_timeval_cmp): Rewrite ospf6_timeval_cmp().
	(ospf6_timeval_add_equal): Function moved from ospf6d.c

	memory leak has been decreased.

	* ospf6_lsa.[ch] ospf6_dbex.c: garbage code has been deleted.

	* ospf6d.h: version 0.9.2

2001-08-07  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_dbex.c ospf6_lsdb.c:
	Retransmition list had a critical bug that breaks LSDB
	synchronization. When new LSA be added to retrans-list,
	old must be removed, but it was not. So new LSA dropped,
	and LSA Acknowledgement did not work. The bug was fixed.

	* ospf6d.h: version 0.9.1

2001-06-20  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_spf.c: crash bug fix in temporary treat code for
	Router-LSA whose LS-ID != 0

	* ospf6_dbex.c: RFC2328 13.(4) was wrongly coded.
	    (4) Else if the LSA's LS age is equal to MaxAge, and there is
            currently *NO* instance of the LSA in the router's link state
	    ...

	* ospf6_lsa.c: RFC2328 13.1 checksum tie breaker
	had been neglected, and has just added now.

	* ospf6d.h: version 0.9.0
	ospf6d expected to work with hitachi gr2000 from these fixes.

2001-06-12  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_lsa.c: Fix bug in creating Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA.
	DR was mis-include others prefixes advertised by their Link-LSA.

	* ospf6_route.c: Fix bug in calculating intra area routes.
	Not all prefixes in Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA was calculated.

	* ospf6_spf.c:
	Changed to quit when a error occured in calculating SPF tree.
	Very messy hack for the bug reported by [zebra 8807]. This
	is not tested yet.
	Changed to quit SPF calculation when a nexthop calculation
	errors.

	* ospf6_zebra.c:
	Support for interface address deletion.

	Interface stub check in Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA origination 
	was wrong. - fixed.

	* ospf6_area.h, ospf6_dbex.c, ospf6_interface.c,
	ospf6_interface.h, ospf6_lsa.c, ospf6_lsa.h, ospf6_lsdb.c,

	New LSDB functions, but not changed to be used.

	* ospf6d.h:
	Version: 0.8.s

2001-03-28  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_area.c ospf6_area.h ospf6_dbex.c ospf6_dump.c
	ospf6_interface.c ospf6_interface.h ospf6_lsa.c
	ospf6_message.c ospf6_redistribute.c ospf6_spf.c ospf6_top.c
	ospf6_top.h ospf6_zebra.c ospf6d.c ospf6d.h: cleaning.

2001-03-24  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6d.h:
	version: 0.8.r

	* ospf6_neighbor.[ch], ospf6_lsa.[ch]:
	just clean up and log clearify.

	* ospf6_message.[ch]:
	Packet receiving function and dumping OSPFv3 packet has been
	changed simple and clean.

	* ospf6_dbex.[ch], ospf6_interface.[ch], ospf6_lsdb.[ch],
	  ospf6_neighbor.[ch], ospf6_nsm.[ch]:
	LSList(i.e. summary list, request list, retrans list, etc) have
	been rewritten based on new LSDB module. The main LSDB have not
	yet shifted to this new module, but will shift eventually.
	This change expected to resolve the problem that the ospf6d keeps
	on sending redundant LSUpdate/LSAck.

	* ospf6_interface.c: changed default MTU from 1500 to 1280.
	It was possible that the ospf6d could not send packet (e.g.
	LSUpdate in response to LSReq in my case) when the packet
	size accidentally reached near 1500 (I was forget about IP
	header :p). It is a bit illegal to set MTU 1280 constantly,
	but I failed once with I/F MTU from kernel (through zebra),
	and thinks that 1280 is more stable than kernel variable.
	Comments will be appriciated.

2001-03-15  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_dbex.c, ospf6_interface.c, ospf6_ism.c, ospf6_lsdb.[ch],
	  ospf6_neighbor.c, ospf6_spf.c, ospf6d.c:
	Fix for crash. ospf6d has ever been crashing when
	'no interface' command executed, and when starting up with
	the configuration which does not include 'router ospf6'.
	these has been fixed.

2001-02-24  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_lsa.c, ospf6_message.c:
	LSA summary (exchanged while Adjacency bring up) may expire
	(may reach MaxAge). Handling this has been added but
	it's a little bit quick hack.

	* ospf6_message.c:
	Thread chain bug fixed. Read network thread chain has been cut
	when receive packets on not-enabled interface. this was wrong
	and fixed.

2001-02-24  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_message.c:
	I/F MTU check part on sending packet had some bug, and it's fixed.
	Ospf6d has believed a value from zebra as I/F MTU, but from now
	I/F MTU is set to constant 1500. This is workaround for ATM.

2001-02-01  Kunihiro Ishiguro  <kunihiro@zebra.org>

	* zebra-0.91 is released.

2001-01-04  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_mesg.c: add I/F Mtu check for sending LS Update.

	* ospf6_dbex.c, ospf6_mesg.c, ospf6_neighbor.c, ospf6_neighbor.h,
	ospf6_spf.c: Changed type of hisaddr field in ospf6_neighbor
	structure, from sockaddr_in6 to in6_addr. No protocol/processing
	changed.

2001-01-04  Yasuhiro Ohara  <yasu@sfc.wide.ad.jp>

	* ospf6_mesg.c, ospf6_neighbor.[ch]: Speed up of
	Database Exchange.
	version: 0.8.j

	Because the LS Request list was checked only when attempt
	to send (retransmit) LS Request packet, Loading state lasted
	long (for RxmtInterval) unexpectedly. This was fixed; LS Request
	packet will be send as soon as one received a LS Update packet.

2001-01-01  Kunihiro Ishiguro  <kunihiro@zebra.org>

	* ospf6d.h (OSPF6_VTYSH_PATH): Change "/tmp/ospf6d" to
