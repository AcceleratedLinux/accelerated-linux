@chapter IPv6 Support

Zebra fully supports IPv6 routing.  As described so far, Zebra supports
RIPng, OSPFv3 and BGP-4+.  You can give IPv6 addresses to an interface
and configure static IPv6 routing information.  Zebra-IPv6 also provides
automatic address configuration via a feature called @code{address
auto configuration}.  To do it, the router must send router advertisement
messages to the all nodes that exist on the network.
