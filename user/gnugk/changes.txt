- BUGFIX(radproto.cxx) fixed invalid signed/unsigned conversion that caused
  some functions to return unexpected results
- BUGFIX(Neighbor.cxx) LCF is considered to come from a given neighbor
  if either IP:PORT or neighbor identifier inside LCF nonstandarparam field matches
  (was: neighbor identifier inside LCF nonstandarparam field or, if the field
  is missing, IP:PORT)

- RAS messages can be forwarded to other gatekeepers
- TCP parameters can be configured in the config file
- what gateway to use on what E.164 prefix can be specified in the

  that are replaced by another E.164 number
- many bug fixes...

- the timeToLive filed in RCF can be set on the command line with -l

  patch from Seungoh Jhung
- support for lightweight registration updates
- on shutdown all registered endpoint receive a UnregistrationRequest
- support for gateways: for gateways we only compare the prefix of
  the E.164 address the gateway registered and assume that the gateway
  provides access to the whole address space (needs testing!)
  input from Frank Breitenbach
- new command line option -h <ip> to specify the ip number the
  gatekeeper binds to. Now you can use IP aliases on Linux and
  start as many gatekeepers as you want.
