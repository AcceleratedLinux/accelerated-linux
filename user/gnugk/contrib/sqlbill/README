GnuGk Sample Billing Platform
======================

This is a system that can be used to provide AAA 
(Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) services 
to Voice over IP networks managed by the GNU Gatekeeper.
It's also possible to use it with MERA and Cisco devices.

It consists of three major components:
	GnuGk (2.0 or 2.2) H.323 gatekeeper (http://www.gnugk.org)
	FreeRADIUS RADIUS server (http://www.freeradius.org) (optional)
	PostgreSQL database server (http://www.postgresql.org)
	
All these application are open source and have been proven
to be stable, mature products.

What you may expect from this system:
1. Endpoint authentication based on a h323id/password pair.
2. Automatic assignment of specified E.164/H.323 ID to endpoints.
4. Restricting aliases an endpoint is allowed to register with.
5. Restricting IP address an endpoint can register/call from.
6. Call authorization:
   - call duration limit based on available account balance
   - allow only fixed set of destination numbers (tariff table)
   - flat tariffs
7. Call accounting:
   - storing call info to the SQL database when the call is started,
     disconnected and in progress (incremental accounting updates)
   - automatic account balance update after call state is updated
     or the call is disconnected
   - support for both originating and terminating account
	 
What you will not find here:
1. User interface (this package contains only SQL schema and configuration
   files for FreeRADIUS and GnuGk).
2. A detailed manual.

Either:
  3. Install FreeRADIUS server and configure it properly.

     and SQLAcct modules.
