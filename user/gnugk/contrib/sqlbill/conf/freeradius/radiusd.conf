## radiusd.conf	-- FreeRADIUS server configuration file.
##
## Adopted to work with GnuGk sample prepaid system

#  	The location of other config files and
#  	logfiles are declared in this file
#
#  	Also general configuration for modules can be done
#  	in this file, it is exported through the API to
#  	modules that ask for it.
#
#	The configuration variables defined here are of the form ${foo}
#	They are local to this file, and do not change from request to
#	request.
#
#	The per-request variables are of the form %{Attribute-Name}, and
#	are taken from the values of the attribute in the incoming
#	request.  See 'doc/variables.txt' for more information.

#
# libdir: Where to find the rlm_* modules.
#
#   This should be automatically set at configuration time.
#
#   If the server builds and installs, but fails at execution time
#   with an 'undefined symbol' error, then you can use the libdir
#   directive to work around the problem.
#
#   The cause is usually that a library has been installed on your
#   system in a place where the dynamic linker CANNOT find it.  When
#   executing as root (or another user), your personal environment MAY
#   be set up to allow the dynamic linker to find the library.  When
#   executing as a daemon, FreeRADIUS MAY NOT have the same
#   personalized configuration.
#
#   To work around the problem, find out which library contains that symbol,
#   and add the directory containing that library to the end of 'libdir',
#   with a colon separating the directory names.  NO spaces are allowed.
#
#   e.g. libdir = /usr/local/lib:/opt/package/lib
#
#   You can also try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
#   in a script which starts the server.
#
#   If that does not work, then you can re-configure and re-build the
#   server to NOT use shared libraries, via:
#
#	./configure --disable-shared
#	make
#	make install
#
libdir = ${exec_prefix}/lib

#  pidfile: Where to place the PID of the RADIUS server.
#
#  The server may be signalled while it's running by using this
#  file.
#
#  This file is written when ONLY running in daemon mode.
#
#  e.g.:  kill -HUP `cat /var/run/radiusd/radiusd.pid`
#
pidfile = ${run_dir}/radiusd.pid


# user/group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run radiusd as.
#
#   If these are commented out, the server will run as the user/group
#   that started it.  In order to change to a different user/group, you
#   MUST be root ( or have root privleges ) to start the server.
#
#   We STRONGLY recommend that you run the server with as few permissions
#   as possible.  That is, if you're not using shadow passwords, the
#   user and group items below should be set to 'nobody'.
#
#    On SCO (ODT 3) use "user = nouser" and "group = nogroup".
#
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(group) when the value of
#  (unsigned)group is above 60000; don't use group nobody on these systems!
#
#  On systems with shadow passwords, you might have to set 'group = shadow'
#  for the server to be able to read the shadow password file.  If you can
#  authenticate users while in debug mode, but not in daemon mode, it may be
#  that the debugging mode server is running as a user that can read the
#  shadow info, and the user listed below can not.
#
# user = nobody
# group = nogroup

#  max_request_time: The maximum time (in seconds) to handle a request.
#
#  Requests which take more time than this to process may be killed, and
#  a REJECT message is returned.
#
#  WARNING: If you notice that requests take a long time to be handled,
#  then this MAY INDICATE a bug in the server, in one of the modules
#  used to handle a request, OR in your local configuration.
#
#  This problem is most often seen when using an SQL database.  If it takes
#  more than a second or two to receive an answer from the SQL database,
#  then it probably means that you haven't indexed the database.  See your
#  SQL server documentation for more information.
#
#  Useful range of values: 5 to 120
#
max_request_time = 30

#  delete_blocked_requests: If the request takes MORE THAN 'max_request_time'
#  to be handled, then maybe the server should delete it.
#
#  If you're running in threaded, or thread pool mode, this setting
#  should probably be 'no'.  Setting it to 'yes' when using a threaded
#  server MAY cause the server to crash!
#
delete_blocked_requests = no

#  cleanup_delay: The time to wait (in seconds) before cleaning up
#  a reply which was sent to the NAS.
#
#  The RADIUS request is normally cached internally for a short period
#  of time, after the reply is sent to the NAS.  The reply packet may be
#  lost in the network, and the NAS will not see it.  The NAS will then
#  re-send the request, and the server will respond quickly with the
#  cached reply.
#
#  If this value is set too low, then duplicate requests from the NAS
#  MAY NOT be detected, and will instead be handled as seperate requests.
#
#  If this value is set too high, then the server will cache too many
#  requests, and some new requests may get blocked.  (See 'max_requests'.)
#
#  Useful range of values: 2 to 10
#
cleanup_delay = 5

#  max_requests: The maximum number of requests which the server keeps
#  track of.  This should be 256 multiplied by the number of clients.
#  e.g. With 4 clients, this number should be 1024.
#
#  If this number is too low, then when the server becomes busy,
#  it will not respond to any new requests, until the 'cleanup_delay'
#  time has passed, and it has removed the old requests.
#
#  If this number is set too high, then the server will use a bit more
#  memory for no real benefit.
#
#  If you aren't sure what it should be set to, it's better to set it
#  too high than too low.  Setting it to 1000 per client is probably
#  the highest it should be.
#
#  Useful range of values: 256 to infinity
#
max_requests = 1024

#  bind_address:  Make the server listen on a particular IP address, and
#  send replies out from that address.  This directive is most useful
#  for machines with multiple IP addresses on one interface.
#
#  It can either contain "*", or an IP address, or a fully qualified
#  Internet domain name.  The default is "*"
#
bind_address = *

#  port: Allows you to bind FreeRADIUS to a specific port.
#
#  The default port that most NAS boxes use is 1645, which is historical.
#  RFC 2138 defines 1812 to be the new port.  Many new servers and
#  NAS boxes use 1812, which can create interoperability problems.
#
#  The port is defined here to be 0 so that the server will pick up
#  the machine's local configuration for the radius port, as defined
#  in /etc/services.
#
#  If you want to use the default RADIUS port as defined on your server,
#  (usually through 'grep radius /etc/services') set this to 0 (zero).
#
#  A port given on the command-line via '-p' over-rides this one.
#
port = 0

#  hostname_lookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
#  e.g., www.freeradius.org (on) or 206.47.27.232 (off).
#
#  The default is 'off' because it would be overall better for the net
#  if people had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it
#  means that each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup
#  request to the nameserver.   Enabling hostname_lookups will also
#  mean that your server may stop randomly for 30 seconds from time
#  to time, if the DNS requests take too long.
#
#  Turning hostname lookups off also means that the server won't block
#  for 30 seconds, if it sees an IP address which has no name associated
#  with it.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
hostname_lookups = no

#  Core dumps are a bad thing.  This should only be set to 'yes'
#  if you're debugging a problem with the server.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
allow_core_dumps = no

#  Regular expressions
#
#  These items are set at configure time.  If they're set to "yes",
#  then setting them to "no" turns off regular expression support.
#
#  If they're set to "no" at configure time, then setting them to "yes"
#  WILL NOT WORK.  It will give you an error.

usercollide = no

# lower_user / lower_pass:  
# Lower case the username/password "before" or "after"
# attempting to authenticate.  
#
#  If "before", the server will first modify the request and then try
#  to auth the user.  If "after", the server will first auth using the
#  values provided by the user.  If that fails it will reprocess the
#  request after modifying it as you specify below.
#
#  This is as close as we can get to case insensitivity.  It is the
#  admin's job to ensure that the username on the auth db side is
#  *also* lowercase to make this work
#
# Default is 'no' (don't lowercase values)
# Valid values = "before" / "after" / "no"
#
lower_user = no
lower_pass = no

# nospace_user / nospace_pass:
#
#  Some users like to enter spaces in their username or password
#  incorrectly.  To save yourself the tech support call, you can
#  eliminate those spaces here:
#
# Default is 'no' (don't remove spaces)
# Valid values = "before" / "after" / "no" (explanation above)

# SECURITY CONFIGURATION
#
#  There may be multiple methods of attacking on the server.  This
#  section holds the configuration items which minimize the impact
#  of those attacks
#
security {
	#
	#  max_attributes: The maximum number of attributes
	#  permitted in a RADIUS packet.  Packets which have MORE
	#  than this number of attributes in them will be dropped.
	#
	#  If this number is set too low, then no RADIUS packets
	#  will be accepted.
	#
	#  If this number is set too high, then an attacker may be
	#  able to send a small number of packets which will cause
	#  the server to use all available memory on the machine.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "allow any number of attributes"
	max_attributes = 200

	#
	#  delayed_reject: When sending an Access-Reject, it can be
	#  delayed for a few seconds.  This may help slow down a DoS
	#  attack.  It also helps to slow down people trying to brute-force
	#  crack a users password.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "send rejects immediately"
	#
	#  If this number is set higher than 'cleanup_delay', then the
	#  rejects will be sent at 'cleanup_delay' time, when the request
	#  is deleted from the internal cache of requests.
	#
	#  Useful ranges: 1 to 5
	reject_delay = 0

	#
	#  status_server: Whether or not the server will respond
	#  to Status-Server requests.
	#
	#  Normally this should be set to "no", because they're useless.
	#  See: http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Keep-Alives
	#
	#  However, certain NAS boxes may require them.	
	#
	#  When sent a Status-Server message, the server responds with
	#  and Access-Accept packet, containing a Reply-Message attribute,
	#  which is a string describing how long the server has been
	#  running.

# THREAD POOL CONFIGURATION
#
#  The thread pool is a long-lived group of threads which
#  take turns (round-robin) handling any incoming requests.
#
#  You probably want to have a few spare threads around,
#  so that high-load situations can be handled immediately.  If you
#  don't have any spare threads, then the request handling will
#  be delayed while a new thread is created, and added to the pool.
#
#  You probably don't want too many spare threads around,
#  otherwise they'll be sitting there taking up resources, and
#  not doing anything productive.
#
#  The numbers given below should be adequate for most situations.
#
thread pool {
	#  Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable
	#  ballpark figure.
	start_servers = 2

	#  Limit on the total number of servers running.
	#
	#  If this limit is ever reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it
	#  should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.  It is intended mainly as a brake to
	#  keep a runaway server from taking the system with it as it spirals
	#  down...
	#
	#  You may find that the server is regularly reaching the
	#  'max_servers' number of threads, and that increasing
	#  'max_servers' doesn't seem to make much difference.
	#
	#  If this is the case, then the problem is MOST LIKELY that
	#  your back-end databases are taking too long to respond, and
	#  are preventing the server from responding in a timely manner.
	#
	#  The solution is NOT do keep increasing the 'max_servers'
	#  value, but instead to fix the underlying cause of the
	#  problem: slow database, or 'hostname_lookups=yes'.
	#
	#  For more information, see 'max_request_time', above.
	#
	max_servers = 10

	#  Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess
	#  how many servers you need, FreeRADIUS dynamically adapts to
	#  the load it sees, that is, it tries to maintain enough
	#  servers to handle the current load, plus a few spare
	#  servers to handle transient load spikes.
	#
	#  It does this by periodically checking how many servers are
	#  waiting for a request.  If there are fewer than
	#  min_spare_servers, it creates a new spare.  If there are
	#  more than max_spare_servers, some of the spares die off.

	#  the server.  If so, set this value to 300 or so, so that the

# MODULE CONFIGURATION
#
#  The names and configuration of each module is located in this section.
#
#  After the modules are defined here, they may be referred to by name,
#  in other sections of this configuration file.
#
modules {
	#
	#  Each module has a configuration as follows:
	#
	#	name [ instance ] {
	#		config_item = value
	#		...
	#	}
	#
	#  The 'name' is used to load the 'rlm_name' library
	#  which implements the functionality of the module.
	#
	#  The 'instance' is optional.  To have two different instances
	#  of a module, it first must be referred to by 'name'.
	#  The different copies of the module are then created by
	#  inventing two 'instance' names, e.g. 'instance1' and 'instance2'
	#
	#  The instance names can then be used in later configuration
	#  INSTEAD of the original 'name'.  See the 'radutmp' configuration
	#  below for an example.

	#  counter module:
	#  This module takes an attribute (count-attribute).
	#  It also takes a key, and creates a counter for each unique
	#  key.  The count is incremented when accounting packets are
	#  received by the server.  The value of the increment depends
	#  on the attribute type.
	#  If the attribute is Acct-Session-Time or of an integer type we add the
	#  value of the attribute. If it is anything else we increase the
	#  counter by one.
	#
	#  The 'reset' parameter defines when the counters are all reset to
	#  zero.  It can be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or never.
	#
	#  hourly: Reset on 00:00 of every hour
	#  daily: Reset on 00:00:00 every day
	#  weekly: Reset on 00:00:00 on sunday
	#  monthly: Reset on 00:00:00 of the first day of each month
	#
	#  It can also be user defined. It should be of the form:
	#  num[hdwm] where:
	#  h: hours, d: days, w: weeks, m: months
	#  If the letter is ommited days will be assumed. In example:
	#  reset = 10h (reset every 10 hours)
	#  reset = 12  (reset every 12 days)
	#
	#
	#  The check-name attribute defines an attribute which will be
	#  registered by the counter module and can be used to set the
	#  maximum allowed value for the counter after which the user
	#  is rejected.
	#  Something like:
	#
	#  DEFAULT Max-Daily-Session := 36000
	#          Fall-Through = 1
	#
	#  You should add the counter module in the instantiate
	#  section so that it registers check-name before the files
	#  module reads the users file.
	#
	#  If check-name is set and the user is to be rejected then we
	#  send back a Reply-Message and we log a Failure-Message in
	#  the radius.log
	#  If the count attribute is Acct-Session-Time then on each login
	#  we send back the remaining online time as a Session-Timeout attribute
	#
	#  The counter-name can also be used instead of using the check-name
	#  like below:
	#
	#  DEFAULT  Daily-Session-Time > 3600, Auth-Type = Reject
	#      Reply-Message = "You've used up more than one hour today"
	#
	#  The allowed-servicetype attribute can be used to only take
	#  into account specific sessions. For example if a user first
	#  logs in through a login menu and then selects ppp there will
	#  be two sessions. One for Login-User and one for Framed-User
	#  service type. We only need to take into account the second one.
	#
	#  The module should be added in the instantiate, authorize and
	#  accounting sections.  Make sure that in the authorize
	#  section it comes after any module which sets the
	#  'check-name' attribute.

	#  Execute external programs

	#  The first example is useful only for 'xlat'.  To use it,
	#  put 'exec' into the 'instantiate' section.  You can then
	#  do dynamic translation of attributes like:
	#
	#  Attribute-Name = `{%exec:/path/to/program args}`
	#
	#  The value of the attribute will be replaced with the output
	#  of the program which is executed.  Due to RADIUS protocol
	#  limitations, any output over 253 bytes will be ignored.
	#
	#  The RADIUS attributes from the user request will be placed
	#  into environment variables of the executed program, as
	#  described in 'doc/variables.txt'

	#  This is a more general example of the execute module.
	#
	#  If you wish to execute an external program in more than
	#  one section (e.g. 'authorize', 'pre_proxy', etc), then it
	#  is probably best to define a different instance of the
	#  'exec' module for every section.	
	#	
	exec echo {
		#
		#  Wait for the program to finish.
		#
		#  If we do NOT wait, then the program is "fire and
		#  forget", and any output attributes from it are ignored.
		#
		#  If we are looking for the program to output
		#  attributes, and want to add those attributes to the
		#  request, then we MUST wait for the program to
		#  finish, and therefore set 'wait=yes'
		#
		# allowed values: {no, yes}
		wait = yes

		#
		#  The name of the program to execute, and it's
		#  arguments.  Dynamic translation is done on this

		#  work.
		#
		program = "/bin/echo %{User-Name}"

		#
		#  The attributes which are placed into the
		#  environment variables for the program.
		#
		#  Allowed values are:
		#
		#	request		attributes from the request
		#	reply		attributes from the reply
		#	proxy-request	attributes from the proxy request
		#	proxy-reply	attributes from the proxy reply
		#
		#  Note that some attributes may not exist at some
		#  stages.  e.g. There may be no proxy-reply
		#  attributes if this module is used in the
		#  'authorize' section.
		#
		input_pairs = request

		#
		#  Where to place the output attributes (if any) from
		#  the executed program.  The values allowed, and the
		#  restrictions as to availability, are the same as

		#
		output_pairs = reply

		#
		#  When to execute the program.  If the packet
		#  type does NOT match what's listed here, then
		#  the module does NOT execute the program.
		#
		#  For a list of allowed packet types, see
		#  the 'dictionary' file, and look for VALUEs
		#  of the Packet-Type attribute.
		#
		#  By default, the module executes on ANY packet.
		#  Un-comment out the following line to tell the
		#  module to execute only if an Access-Accept is
		#  being sent to the NAS.

	#  attribute in the user profiles and use different pools
	#  for different users. The Pool-Name attribute is a *check* item not
	#  a reply item.
