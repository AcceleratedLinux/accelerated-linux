Known bugs:
* H.245 sockets are bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), Home config option is ignored
  which may cause problems on multihomed hosts (virtual servers)
* a race condition occurs when both endpoints try to establish H.245 connection
  in H.245 routed mode - this makes a call to fail
* authentication/accounting modules do not work fine for gatekeeper forwarded 
  calls (ForwardOnFacility=1), it is recommended to disable this flag
* PostgreSQL driver for SQLxxx modules does not reconnect to the database
  if the connection is lost until gatekeeper reload
* the gatekeeper does not try to bind a socket again if a Q.931/H.245/T.120 port
  is already in use, therefore some calls may fail under specific circumstances
* (2.2.2, fixed in 2.2.3cvs) tunnelled H.245 messages were ignored
* (2.2.x, fixed in 2.2.3cvs) broadcast RAS messages were ignored in the LARGE_FDSET mode
