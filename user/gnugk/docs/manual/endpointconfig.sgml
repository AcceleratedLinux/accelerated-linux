<sect>Per-Endpoint Configuration
<label id="epconfig">
<p>
In addition to the standard configuration file options, per-endpoint configuration
settings can be specified in the config file. The syntax is as follows:

<sect1>Section &lsqb;EP::...&rsqb;
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
[EP::ALIAS]
Key Name=Value String
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/ALIAS/ is replaced with an actual alias for an endpoint the settings
should apply to. Currently, the following options are recognized:

<itemize>
<item><tt/Capacity=10/<newline>
Default: <tt/-1/<newline>
<p>
Call capacity for an endpoint. No more than <tt/Capacity/ concurrent
calls will be sent to this endpoint. In case of gateways, if more than one
gateway matches a dialed number, a call will be sent to the first available
gateway (that has available capacity).

<item><tt/GatewayPriority=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Apply only to gateways. Allow priority based routing in case, when more
than one gateway matches a dialed number. The smaller value the higher priority
is assigned to a gateway. A call is routed to the first available gateway
(that has available capacity) with the highest priority (the smallest
<tt/GatewayPriority/ values). In case whe gateway priority contradicts prefix priority (see section <ref id="gwprefixes" name="[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]">)  
 for details) prefix one has the preference.

<item><tt/GatewayPrefixes=0048,0049:=2,0044/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Additional prefixes for this gateway. Apply only to gateways. 
Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/ can be used here to match any digit 
and disable the prefix.
You may use the := syntax to set a prefix priority in the same manner as in <ref id="gwprefixes" name="[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]"> section. If no priority is set explicitely for a Prefix, the gateway priority is used.


<item><tt/CalledTypeOfNumber=1/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Sets Called-Party-Number type of number to the specified value
for calls sent to this endpoint
(0 - UnknownType, 1 - InternationalType, 2 - NationalType,
3 - NetworkSpecificType, 4 - SubscriberType, 6 - AbbreviatedType, 7 - ReservedType).

<item><tt/CallingTypeOfNumber=1/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Sets Calling-Party-Number type of number to the specified value
for calls sent to this endpoint
(0 - UnknownType, 1 - InternationalType, 2 - NationalType,
3 - NetworkSpecificType, 4 - SubscriberType, 6 - AbbreviatedType, 7 - ReservedType).

<item><tt/Proxy=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
Enables/disables proxying calls sent to this endpoint (0 - do not
change global proxy settings, 1 - force proxy mode, 2 - disable proxy mode).

</itemize>

Example:

<tscreen><verb>
[RasSrv::PermanentEndpoints]
192.168.1.1=gw1;48
192.168.1.2=gw2;48,!4850,!4860,!4869,!4888

[EP::gw1]
Capacity=60
GatewayPriority=1

[EP::gw2]
Capacity=30
GatewayPriority=2
</verb></tscreen>

In this example, calls will be sent to the gateway <tt/gw1/ until its
capacity is fully utilized (60 concurrent calls) and then to the gateway <tt/gw2/.
