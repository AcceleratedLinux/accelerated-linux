<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::GWPrefixes&rsqb;
<label id="gwprefixes">
<p>
This section lists what E.164 numbers are routed to a specific gateway.

<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt>gw-alias=prefix[:=priority][,prefix[:=priority],...]</tt>
<p>
Note you have to specify the alias of the gateway.
If a gateway registered with the alias, all numbers beginning with
the prefixes are routed to this gateway. Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/
can be used here to match any digit and disable the prefix.
A priority can be given to each prefix for each gateway (using := syntax),
so in case of several gateways match the dialed number, the one
with the highest prefix priority will be selected to route the call (when the ActivateFailover switch is ON call will be routed to all selected gateways in order of the prefix priority). The smaller value corresponds to the higher priority. Default value is 1. In case when prefix priority intersectes with GatewayPriority (see section <ref id="epconfig" name="[EP::...]">) prefix one is preferred.
<tag/Example:/
<tt/test-gw=02,03:=3,04.:=1/

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::PermanentEndpoints&rsqb;
<p>
In this section you can put endpoints that don't have RAS support
or that you don't want to be expired. The records will always
keep in registration table of the gatekeeper.
However, You can still unregister it via status port.
Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/
can be used with prefixes here to match any digit and disable the prefix.
You may use := syntax to set a prefix priority in the same manner as in <ref id="gwprefixes" name="[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]"> section.

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::RRQFeatures&rsqb;
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/AcceptEndpointIdentifier=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Whether to accept <bf/endpointIdentifier/ specified in a full RRQ.

<item><tt/AcceptGatewayPrefixes=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
A gateway can register its prefixes with the gatekeeper by containing
<bf/supportedPrefixes/ in the <bf/terminalType/ field of RRQ.
This option defines whether to accept the specified prefixes of a gateway.

<item><tt/OverwriteEPOnSameAddress=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
In some networks an endpoint's IP address may change unexpectedly.  This
may happen when an endpoint is using a PPP connection (e.g. modem or ADSL).
This option defines how to handle a registration request (RRQ) from an IP
address which does not match what we have stored.  The default action is
to reject the request.  With this option enabled the conflicting request
will cause an unregister request (URQ) to be sent for the existing IP
address and the entry to be removed allowing the endpoint to register
with the new address.

<item><tt/IRQPollCount=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
When the gatekeeper does not receive a keep-alive RRQ from an endpoint
within TimeToLive time period, it sends an IRQ message to "poll" the endpoint
and check if it is alive. After IRQPollCount messages are sent and no reply
is received, the endpoint is unregistered. To disable this feature (and unregister
endpoints immediately after TimeToLive timeout), set this variable to 0.
IRQ poll interval is 60 seconds.

<item><tt/SupportDynamicIP=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
When the IP address of an endpoint changes, the gatekeeper can maintain registration. 
This will force the EP to fully reregister if the IP Address changes. 
</itemize>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::ARQFeatures&rsqb;
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/ArjReasonRouteCallToGatekeeper=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
If yes, the gatekeeper rejects an answered ARQ without a pre-existing
CallRec found in the CallTable by reason <bf/routeCallToGatekeeper/
in routed mode.
The endpoint shall release the call immediately and re-send call Setup
to the gatekeeper.

<item><tt/CallUnregisteredEndpoints=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
With this option set on, the gatekeeper will accept an ARQ from a registered
endpoint with <bf/destCallSignalAddress/, no matter the address is belongs
to a registered endpoint or not.
That means you can explicitly specify the IP of endpoint (registered or not)
you want to call.

<item><tt/RemoveTrailingChar=#/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Specify the trailing character to be removed in <bf/destinationInfo/.
For example, if your endpoint incorrectly contains the termination character
like `&num;' in <bf/destinationInfo/, you may remove it by this option.

<item><tt/RoundRobinGateways=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Enable/disable round-robin gateway selection, if more than one gateway
matches a dialed number. If disabled, the first available gateway will be selected.
Otherwise, subsequent calls will be sent to gateways in round-robin fashion.

</itemize>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;NATedEndpoints&rsqb;
<p>
The gatekeeper can automatically detect whether an endpoint is behind NAT.
However, if the detection fails, you can specify it manually in this section.

<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt/alias=true,yes,1,.../
<tag/Example:/
Specify an endpoint with alias 601 is behind NAT.
<quote/<tt/601=true//
