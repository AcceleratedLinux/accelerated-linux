<sect1>About
<p>
<bf>
<url url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="OpenH323 Gatekeeper - The GNU Gatekeeper">
</bf>
is an open-source project that implements an H.323 gatekeeper.
A gatekeeper provides call control services to the H.323 endpoints.
It is an integral part of most useful internet telephony
installations that are based on the H.323 standard.

According to Recommendation H.323, a gatekeeper shall provide the
following services:
<itemize>
<item>Address Translation
<item>Admissions Control
<item>Bandwidth Control
<item>Zone Management
<item>Call Control Signaling
<item>Call Authorization
<item>Bandwidth Management
<item>Call Management
</itemize>

The GNU Gatekeeper implements most of these functions
based on the
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openh323" name="OpenH323">
protocol stack.

Recommendation H.323 is an international standard published by the
<url url="http://www.itu.int/" name="ITU">.
It is a communications standard for audio, video, and data over the Internet.
See also Paul Jones'
<url url="http://www.packetizer.com/voip/h323/papers/primer/" name="A Primer on the H.323 Series Standard">.

For a detailed description of what a gatekeeper does, see
<url url="http://www.iec.org/online/tutorials/h323/topic06.html" name="here">.

<sect1>Copyright
<p>
It is covered by the
<htmlurl url="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html" name="GNU General Public License"> (GNU GPL).
In addition to that, we explicitly grant
the right to link this code to the OpenH323 and OpenSSL library.

Generally speaking, the GNU GPL allows you to copy, distribute, resell or modify
the software, but it requires that all derived works must be published
under GNU GPL also.
That means that you must publish full source for all extensions to
the gatekeeper and for all programs you include the gatekeeper into.
See the file COPYING for details.

If that's not what you want, you must interface to the gatekeeper through
the status port and communicate via TCP with it.
That way you only have to integrate the basic functionality into
the gatekeeper (and provide source for that) and can keep other parts
of your application private.

<sect1>Name
<p>
The formal name of this project is
<em>OpenH323 Gatekeeper - The GNU Gatekeeper</em>,
short <em/GnuGk/.
Please don't confuse it with other gatekeeper projects.

There are several open-source gatekeeper projects based on the OpenH323 protocol stack.

<quote>A gatekeeper available under MPL. The project has been inactive for a period of time now.</quote>
<item><url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openh323" name="OpenGK">
<quote>Only in a very primary grades.</quote>
<item><url url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="OpenH323 Gatekeeper - The GNU Gatekeeper">
<quote>This one, also called GnuGk.</quote>
</itemize>

To have different gatekeepers with very similar names is really
confusing for most users.
Since our "OpenH323 Gatekeeper" was the first on the scene,
it is not our fault that others have chosen similar names.
But to make the distinction a little more clear without confusing
people even more, we have decided to give the project a
subtitle "OpenH323 Gatekeeper - The GNU Gatekeeper" and start
using <tt/gnugk/ as name for executables.

<sect1>Download
<label id="download">

The very latest source code is in the CVS at
<url url="http://openh323gk.cvs.sourceforge.net/openh323gk/openh323gk/" name="Sourceforge Web-GUI">.

<sect1>Mailing Lists
<p>
There are two mailing list for the project, one for the developers and one for the users.

General user questions should be send to the
<url url="mailto:Openh323gk-users@sourceforge.net" name="users mailing list">. You can find the list archive
<url url="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=8549" name="here">.

To report problems or submit bugs/patches, send mails to the
<url url="mailto:Openh323gk-developer@sourceforge.net" name="developers mailing list">.
The list archive is
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=3079" name="here">. Please send user questions to the users mailing list and keep this list to development! If you want to contribute to the project, please
<url url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/openh323gk-developer" name="join the mailing list">.

<bf/Note/:
Please don't send your questions as private emails to individual developer.
We are usually busy. We would <bf/not/ like to be your private consultant,
unless you'd like to pay us.
Send your problems to the appropriate public mailing list so everybody
can help you.

Also please don't send the GnuGk specific problems to the OpenH323
mailing list, or vice verse.
They are different projects, though closely related.

Before you sending an email, make sure you have read the related documents
carefully. Describe your problems clearly and precisely. Show us the
error messages or logs if there is any.
