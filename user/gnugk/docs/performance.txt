===============
3 E1s of G.723.1 continuous traffic (90 calls), ACD = 180s
FastEthernet network, 2Mbit/s of full-duplex bandwidth (1Mbit/s in each direction)
Toshiba Pentium M 1.6GHz, Linux kernel 2.6
GnuGk 2.2.x (no LARGE_FDSET), full proxy mode, no external auth/acct modules (RADIUS/SQL)

CPU utilization: 10-15% (with full tracing level 5 enabled + 10%)
No delay/quality loss mesured as compared to an idle gatekeeper - measured by making
test calls during peak time
===============
4 E1s of G.723.1 continuous traffic (120 calls), ACD=180s
FastEthernet network, 2,5Mbit/s of full-duplex bandwidth (1,25Mbit/s in each direction)
Toshiba Pentium M 1.6GHz, Linux kernel 2.6
GnuGk 2.2.x (no LARGE_FDSET), full proxy mode, RadAliasAuth + RadAcct module, fresh SqlBill
PostreSQL billing installation, everything on the same server

CPU utilization: 30-40%
No delay/quality loss mesured as compared to an idle gatekeeper - measured by making
test calls during peak time

Using the same settings as above, except that GnuGk is compiled with LARGE_FDSET=1024,
CPU utilization decreased to 20-30%
===============
The same configuration as above, except that the gatekeeper is in the signaling routed
mode (no proxy).

CPU utilization: 2-3%
