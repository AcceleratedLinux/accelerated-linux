This is the README for pam_smb v1.1.7
--------------------------------------------------

pam_smb is a PAM module which allows authentication of UNIX users using an NT
server.

***********************************
What's New in this version -- 1.1.7
***********************************

This is a newer issue than the 1.1.6 one. There is another potential
security hole.

REMOTE ROOT EXPLOIT FIX: PLEASE UPGRADE ASAP.

SECURITY UPGRADE: stops guest logins problems with Windows NT
thanks to mirko.dziadzka@systor.com for tracking this down.

This version contains a bug-fix that stops pam_smb from authenticating 
against servers in share mode i.e. Win 95 or samba in share mode.
If you had a share mode server by mistake in your pam_smb.conf
anyone could log in to any a/c on your machine with no password !!!

**************
Features
**************
	o GNU configure support
	o Linux Redhat PAM support
	o GLIBC 2 support ( RH 5.0 )
	o Solaris 2.6 support
	o NT Domain support
	o Encrypted LANMAN password support.
	o Ability to use backup server in case of failure of primary.
	
****************
Getting pam_smb:
****************

ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/pam_smb/
or Samba Mirror.

**********
Installing
**********
1)Untar the distribution and cd into the pam_smb directory.

2) Run configure
./configure
If you want to disable encrypted passwords you can run 
./configure --disable-encrypt-pass

3) run make (must be GNU make)
make 
or maybe on Solaris
gmake

4) This will produce pam_smb_auth.so. 
   Copy this file into the pam modules directory which for Redhat-4.2 is
   /lib/security and for Solaris 2.6 is /usr/lib/security.

5) Configure pam_smb.conf file with the domain and two servers for authentication purposes.

6) Install the module into the PAM system:
For Linux:
	You then need to change the configuration files in /etc/pam.d for the applications you wish to use NT authentication with.

My /etc/pam.d/login is as follows for NT authenticated logins.
Note the pam_smb_auth.so line.

#%PAM-1.0
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_securetty.so
auth	   required	/lib/security/pam_smb_auth.so
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_nologin.so
account    required	/lib/security/pam_pwdb.so
password   required	/lib/security/pam_cracklib.so
password   required	/lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok use_authtok
session    required	/lib/security/pam_pwdb.so

For Solaris:
	You need to change the /etc/pam.conf other line to

other   auth required   /usr/lib/security/pam_smb_auth.so.1


*********************
Further Configuration
*********************

The pam_smb modules has two configuration steps,
	a) Command line options
	b) Configuration file.

A) Command line options
	Most installations can skip this step as the module will 
	work grand without any command line arguments.
	These arguments go in the /etc/pam.d or /etc/pam.conf 
	file on the auth line containing the pam_smb_auth.so module.

	The pam_smb module accepts 3 command line options.
	1. debug - This switches on syslog debugging of the module.
	2. use_first_pass - This is a standard PAM Module command line option.
	*********** N.B. Danger lurks here somewhere *****************
	3. nolocal - This allows authentication of a username/password
			pair which are not in the local password file.
		 Do not switch this on unless you know what you are at.
	**************************************************************

B) Configuration File

The configuration file is stored in /etc/pam_smb.conf and it consists of three
 lines the first containing the NT DOMAIN to be logged on at and the second 
and third are the primary and secondary servers to use. Note these do not have 
to be NT server machines simply machines which can authenticate in the domain.

e.g.
Here is my local copy: where I have server INTEL41 and INTEL42 and the domain is the UNDERGRADUATE domain :
UNDERGRADUATE
INTEL41
INTEL42
----- end ------

*******************
General Information.
*******************

The module is a hacked together version of smblib-0.50, smb-NT-verify, the pam_unix_auth module, and changes made by myself to allow Domain logons and 
other stuff.

Notes:
	The user must be in the password file to allow the user to login.
	If the user hasn't a starred password the password in the file
	will work,
	If the user has a starred password it will go to the NT server
	and validate the user in the domain specified in the conf file

Thanks and a lot of the credit for this go to :

Andrew Morgan <morgan@parc.power.net> -- the Linux PAM project person, and 
writer of the pam_unix_auth.c module.

Richard Sharpe <sharpe@nmesis.enet.dec.com> -- the author of smblib which I
have used a lot of directly.

Christopher Burke <c.burke@mindware.com.au> -- the author of smb-NT-valid
from which I took the validation routine.

The encryption routine is taken straight from samba and is copyright
Andrew Tridgell (author of samba).

All work is my own fault so don't bother any of the above about any bugs
you find in it because I probably introduced them anyways ... 

BUGS: 
This bug is now a bug in login.c a patch to login.c from util-linux
is available on the primary site for pam_smb.
When runnning on a system designed for 2.1.x kernels telnetting to the machine from a box in the hosts file causes login to get SIGSEGV outside my code not sure why ..

*********************************
Old What's new 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0
*********************************

1.0--
Autoconf support added.

0.9--
PAM_SMB now has syslog debugging support and supports some PAM command
line options, fixed RH5.0 imap/pop support.

There is also a command line option to disable local password file checking.
This means no local passwd file or shadow checking is done. This means
a username not in the password file can be checked, this feature is for
people who supply UID's and other information from another module
i.e. Radius or something similar. I advise leaving if off as it stops root
from logging in if switched off.              

0.8--
Pam_smb now has Solaris 2.6 PAM support. It can be compiled using either the 
SunPro cc compiler or gcc-2.7.2.3 for Solaris 2.6. 

pam_smb now has support for encrypted passwords turned on. It will now use
encrypted LANMAN/NT passwords ala the encrypt password option on samba. This 
allows a SAMBA server using encrypted passwords to authenticate users now, so
you can now authenticate from the smbpasswd file by setting up samba with 
encrypted passwords switched on, and pointing the pam_smb.conf at the
localhost server. 

0.7--
Encryption can be disabled by editing the Makefile.
