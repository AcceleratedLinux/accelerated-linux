Release Notes for siproxd-0.5.11
===============================

Major changes since 0.5.10:
   Now compiles with libosip2-2.2.0 (changes in libpsip API).
   Siproxd does now support running "in front of" a NAT router.
   

General Overview:
 - SIP (RFC3261) Proxy for SIP based softphones hidden behind a
   masquerading firewall
 - works with "dial-up" conenctions (dynamic IP addresses)
 - Multiple local users/hosts can be masqueraded simultaneously
 - Access control (IP based) for incoming traffic
 - Proxy Authentication for registration of local clients (User Agents)
   with individual passwords for each user
 - May be used as pure Outbound proxy (registration of local UAs
   to a 3rd party registrar)
 - Fli4l OPT_SIP (still experimental) available, check
   http://home.arcor.de/jsffm/fli4l/
 - runs on various operating systems (see below)
 - Full duplex RTP data stream proxy for *incoming* and *outgoing*
   audio data - no firewall masquerading entries needed
 - Port range to be used for RTP traffic is configurable
   (-> easy to set up apropriate firewall rules for RTP traffic)
 - RTP proxy can handle multiple RTP streams (eg. audio + video)
   within a single SIP session.
 - Symmetric RTP support
 - Symmetric SIP signalling support
 - Supports running in a chroot jail and changing user-ID after startup
 - All configuration done via one simple ascii configuration file
 - Logging to syslog in daemon mode
 - RPM package
 - The host part of UA registration entries can be masqueraded
   (mask_host, masked_host config items). Some Siemens SIP phones seem to
   need this 'feature'.
 - Provider specific outbound proxies can be configured
 - Can run "in front of" a NAT router.(in the local LAN segment)

Requirements:
 - pthreads (Linux)
 - glibc2 / libc5 / uClibc

 If you have siproxd successfully running with another SIP phone
 and/or service provider, please drop me a short note so I can update
 the list.

Known bugs:
   - SRV DNS records are not yet looked up, only A records
   There will be more...

If you port siproxd to a new platform or do other kinds of changes
or bugfixes that might be of general interest, please drop me a
line. Also if you intend to include siproxd into a software
distribution I'd be happy to get a short notice.
