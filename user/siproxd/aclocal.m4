dnl @synopsis ACX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
dnl
dnl This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX
dnl threads.  It sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads
dnl library and linker flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable
dnl to any special C compiler flags that are needed.  (The user can also
dnl force certain compiler flags/libs to be tested by setting these
dnl environment variables.)
dnl
dnl Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
dnl multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise).
dnl (This is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
dnl
dnl If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to
dnl use these variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
dnl
dnl        LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
dnl        CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
dnl        CC="$PTHREAD_CC"
dnl
dnl In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute
dnl constant has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
dnl to that name (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
dnl
dnl ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads
dnl library is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands
dnl to run it if it is not found.  If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified,
dnl the default action will define HAVE_PTHREAD.
dnl
dnl Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform,
dnl or if you have any other suggestions or comments.  This macro was
dnl based on work by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (www.fftw.org)
dnl (with help from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread
dnl macros posted by AFC to the autoconf macro repository.  We are also
dnl grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.

# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

# Rely on autoconf to set up CDPATH properly.
