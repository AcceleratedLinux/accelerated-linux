TODOs, in random order:
=======================

- siproxd daemonized: looks like clashes between threads
- lost 200 ACK immediately before RTP starts...

- /var/run PID file

- check via loop and private IP addresses
  can comment be used to store a unique ID in there?

- multiple inbound interfaces - do I need to be aware of inbound at all?

- Documentation (yeah, yeah...)

- general security issues
- security tests for received SIP messages (function securitycheck)

- automagically create a proper config file during install

- get_ip_by_host: reduce DNS timeouts (seems to be a more complex problem...)

- via loop detection: send 482 error code


- feature: don't bind to 0.0.0.0 address, but only to inbound/outbound IF's
  (defined by IFNAME)

RFC3261 non-compliance:
- Record-Route header handling

- OpenBSD: Warning for redefinition of MACROS
