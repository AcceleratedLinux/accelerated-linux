.Sh NAME
.Nm netrc, .netrc
.Nd user configuration for ftp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This file contains configuration and autologin information for the 
File Transfer Protocol client 
.Xr ftp 1 .
.Pp
The
.Pa .netrc
file contains login and initialization information
used by the auto-login process.
It resides in the user's home directory.
The following tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces,
tabs, or new-lines:
.Bl -tag -width password
.It Ic machine Ar name
Identify a remote machine
.Ar name .
The auto-login process searches the
.Pa .netrc
file for a
.Ic machine
token that matches the remote machine specified on the
.Nm ftp
command line or as an
.Ic open
command argument.
Once a match is made, the subsequent
.Pa .netrc
tokens are processed,
stopping when the end of file is reached or another
.Ic machine
or a
.Ic default
token is encountered.
.It Ic default
This is the same as
.Ic machine
.Ar name
except that
.Ic default
matches any name.
There can be only one
.Ic default
token, and it must be after all
.Ic machine
tokens.
This is normally used as:
.Pp
.Dl default login anonymous password user@site
.Pp
thereby giving the user
.Ar automatic
anonymous ftp login to
machines not specified in
.Pa .netrc .
This can be overridden
by using the
.Fl n
flag to disable auto-login.
.It Ic login Ar name
Identify a user on the remote machine.
If this token is present, the auto-login process will initiate
a login using the specified
.Ar name .
.It Ic password Ar string
Supply a password.
If this token is present, the auto-login process will supply the
specified string if the remote server requires a password as part
of the login process.
Note that if this token is present in the
.Pa .netrc
file for any user other
than
.Ar anonymous  ,
.Nm ftp
will abort the auto-login process if the
.Pa .netrc
is readable by
anyone besides the user.
.It Ic account Ar string
Supply an additional account password.
If this token is present, the auto-login process will supply the
specified string if the remote server requires an additional
account password, or the auto-login process will initiate an
.Dv ACCT
command if it does not.
.It Ic macdef Ar name
Define a macro.
This token functions like the
.Nm ftp
.Ic macdef
command functions.
A macro is defined with the specified name; its contents begin with the
next
.Pa .netrc
line and continue until a null line (consecutive new-line
characters) is encountered.
If a macro named
.Ic init
is defined, it is automatically executed as the last step in the
auto-login process.
