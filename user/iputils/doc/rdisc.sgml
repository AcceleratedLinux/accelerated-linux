<refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>
<command/rdisc/ implements client side of the ICMP router discover protocol.
<command/rdisc/ is invoked at boot time to populate the network
routing tables with default routes. 
</para>

<para>
<command/rdisc/ listens on the ALL_HOSTS (224.0.0.1) multicast address
(or <replaceable/receive_address/ provided it is given) 
for ROUTER_ADVERTISE messages from routers. The received
messages are handled by first ignoring those listed router addresses
with which the host does not share a network. Among the remaining addresses
the ones with the highest preference are selected as default routers
and a default route is entered in the kernel routing table
for each one of them.
</para>

<para>
Optionally, <command/rdisc/ can avoid waiting for routers to announce 
themselves by sending out a few ROUTER_SOLICITATION messages
to the ALL_ROUTERS (224.0.0.2) multicast address 
(or <replaceable/send_address/ provided it is given) 
when it is started.
</para>

<para>
A timer is associated with each router address and the address will
no longer be considered for inclusion in the the routing tables if the 
timer expires before a new 
<emphasis/advertise/ message is received from the router.
The address will also be excluded from consideration if the host receives an 
<emphasis/advertise/
message with the preference being maximally negative.
</para>

<para>
Server side of router discovery protocol is supported by Cisco IOS
and by any more or less complete UNIX routing daemon, f.e <command/gated/.
</para>

<refsect1><title>OPTIONS</title>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-a/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Accept all routers independently of the preference they have in their 
<emphasis/advertise/ messages.
Normally <command/rdisc/ only accepts (and enters in the kernel routing
tables) the router or routers with the highest preference.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-b/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Opposite to <option/-a/, i.e. install only router with the best
preference value. It is default behaviour.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-d/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Send debugging messages to syslog.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-f/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Run <command/rdisc/ forever even if no routers are found.
Normally <command/rdisc/ gives up if it has not received any 
<emphasis/advertise/ message after after soliciting three times,
in which case it exits with a non-zero exit code.
If <option/-f/ is not specified in the first form then 
<option/-s/ must be specified.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-s/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Send three <emphasis/solicitation/ messages initially to quickly discover
the routers when the system is booted.
When <option/-s/ is specified <command/rdisc/
exits with a non-zero exit code if it can not find any routers.
This can be overridden with the <option/-f/ option.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-t/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Test mode. Do not go to background.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>


 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-v/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Be verbose i.e. send lots of debugging messages to syslog.
  </para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term><option/-V/</term>
  <listitem><para>
Print version and exit.
