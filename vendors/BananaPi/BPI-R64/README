BananaPI BPI-R64
----------------

This is just some random notes on building and running on the BananaPi
BPI-R64 platform. This is very much a work in progress.

The BananaPI/BPI-R64 board is built around a Mediatek MT7622 SoC.
This is an ARM64 (aarch64) CPU based device.

Generate images for this board using the BananaPI/BPI-R64 accelerated linux
target. The default is to select the musl C-library when building.
The build will generate a single "itb" u-boot mutli-image format binary,
images/bpi-r64.itb. A number of the build artifacts, like kernel and
root filesystem, are also present in that images/ directory.

Currently the BPI-R64 is only capable of booting from the SD-card
interface. So you will need to setup an appropriately formatted SD-card
to test with. I used these instructions to get started, and to provide
the initial u-boot binary:

    https://forum.banana-pi.org/t/bpi-r64-download-and-setup-separate-atf-image-for-booting-directly-into-kernel-or-u-boot/12806

Booting the SD-card will take you directly to the u-boot console on the
debug serial port.

Copy the generated bpi-r64.itb file onto the EXT4 partition of the SD-card.
With this in place when you boot up you can load and run that from the
u-boot command line:

    ext4load mmc 1 0x60000000 bpi-r64.itb
    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0
    bootm 0x60000000

The console is on a 3-pin inline header. You will need a TTL-to-RS232
converter connected and in place to use it. The three pins are GND, RX, TX,
so you need to wire across to the 40-pin DIP header to get 3.3V (it is on
pin 1). The console serial port is at the default 115200,8,n,1.
