BananaPI BPI-R3
---------------

This is just some random notes on building and running on the BananaPi
BPI-R3 platform. This is very much a work in progress.

The BananaPI/BPI-R3 board is built around a Mediatek MT7986 SoC.
This is an ARM64 (aarch64) CPU SoC, with quad core Cortex A53 CPUs @ 2.0GHz
five 1Gb copper ethernet ports, and twp SFP modules.

Generate images for this board using the BananaPI/BPI-R3 accelerated linux
target. The default is to select the musl C-library when building.
The build will generate a 3 files to be loaded onto the BPI-R3 board.

To network load from the u-boot command line do:

    setenv ipaddr 192.168.2.1
    setenv serverip 192.168.2.22
    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x70000000,64M
    tftpboot 0x46000000 kernel
    tftpboot 0x60000000 mt7986a-bananapi-bpi-r3.dtb
    tftpboot 0x70000000 rootfs.bin
    booti 0x46000000 - 0x60000000

The console is on a 3-pin inline header. You will need a TTL-to-RS232
converter connected and in place to use it. The three pins are GND, RX, TX,
so you need to wire across to the 40-pin DIP header to get 3.3V (it is on
pin 1). The console serial port is at the default 115200,8,n,1.
