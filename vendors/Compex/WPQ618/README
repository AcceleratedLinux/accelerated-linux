COMPEX WPQ618
-------------

This is just some random notes on building and running on the WPQ618
platform. This is very much a work in progress.

The Compex/WPQ618 board is built around a Qualcomm IPQ6018 SoC. (This is an
ARM64 CPU based device).

Generate images for this board using the Compex/WPQ618 accelerated linux
target. The default is to select the musl C-library when building.
The build will generate a single "itb" u-boot mutli-image format binary,
images/wpq618.itb. A number of the build artifacts, like kernel and
root filesystem, are also present in that images/ directory.

You can load onto the WPQ618 board using the usual u-boot loader installed
in the boot ROM of the WPQ618 board. Break into the u-boot command line
as it boots (hitting a key when it is waiting for input) and then run the
following commands:

    setenv bootargs console=ttyMSM0,115200n8 root=/dev/ram0 
    dhcp 0x60000000 wpq618.itb
    bootm 0x60000000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses setup with DHCP and
tftp server.

The console is on a 4-pin inline header. You will need a TTL-to-RS232
converter connected and in place to use it. The console serial port is at
the default 115200,8,n,1.
