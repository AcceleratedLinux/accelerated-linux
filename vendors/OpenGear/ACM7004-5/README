OPENGEAR/ACM7004-5
------------------

These notes are to assist in transitioning to running DAL firmware on
an OpenGear/ACM7004-5.


CONSOLE SETUP
-------------

The native CPU serial port is brought out on CON7 of the PCB. It is a
true RS-232 port (+5/-5V levels), with GND/RX/TX pins only. Wiring that
out you can connect directly to a PC (or similar) serial port. The
default is the usual 115200/8/1/n.

On unit power up you will see the Marvell memory initializer and u-boot
console trace come out. If you hit keys while it is booting you can break
into the u-boot console.


NETWORK LOADING
---------------

With the serial console setup and at the u-boot prompt you can manually
network load a DAL firmware image. Run commands like this:

    dhcp
    tftp image.bin
    setenv bootargs "console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=$loadaddr,16M"
    gofsk $loadaddr

Note that I have maintained the primary linux console on this internal
serial port for now. So after booting linux you will be able to login
on this internal serial port.


FLASHING IMAGE
--------------

The generated DAL firmware binary image is compatible with the OpenGear
firmware images. So you can flash in a DAL firmaware image to replace the
existing OpenGear firmware.

From a shell login (when running DAL):

    netflash 192.168.210.2 image.bin

(Of course substituing appropriate server IP address in that netflash)
