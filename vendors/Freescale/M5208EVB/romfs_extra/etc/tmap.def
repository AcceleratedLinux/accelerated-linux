# This file maps out the entire physical 4BG memory space of the Coldfire processor.
# It is broken into segments which are flagged as accessible or inaccessible.
# This file is used by gdbserver to implement a software access protection scheme
# that prevents gdbserver from crashing when it accesses hardware-protected
# memory addresses.

# A segment is defined by a line of text containing three numeric values.
# The first defines the start address of the segment; the second value
# defines the size; and the third is a flag that defines access rules.

# Valid flag values are as follow:
# - If bit zero of the flag is set, the segment is readable.
# - If bit one of the flag is set, the segment is writable.
# - If neither bit zero or one is set, the segment is inaccessible.

# Each entry's start address must be equal to the sum of the start address
# and size in the previous entry. The first entry must have a start address of 0.
# Numeric values may be in decimal, octal (first digit must be 0) or hex (prefixed with 0x).
