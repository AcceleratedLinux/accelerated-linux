DIGI iMX8
---------

This is just some random notes on building and running on the iMX8 EVK
platform. This is very much a work in progress.

Generate images for this board using the Freescale/IMX8EVK accelerated linux
target. The default is to select the musl C-library when building.
The build will generate separate kernel, root filesystem and devicetree blobs.

You can load onto the iMX8 board using the usual u-boot loader installed
in the boot ROM of the board.

  setenv bootargs console=ttymxc1,115200n8 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x80000000,64M
  setenv ipaddr 192.168.0.66
  setenv serverip 192.168.0.22
  tftpboot 0x40480000 kernel.bin
  tftpboot 0x7c000000 imx8mp-evk.dtb
  tftpboot 0x80000000 rootfs.bin
  booti 0x40480000 - 0x7c000000

The serial console is on the micro-USB debug port (J23). You will need a
micro-USB to standard USB cable. The serial console will appear on the 3rd
USB serial port of a host Linux system. The console serial port is at the
default 115200,8,n,1.
