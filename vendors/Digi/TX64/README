ACL on the TX64
---------------

This is a collection of notes on installing an ACL built image onto the
Digi/TX64. This is very much a work in progress.

Basic method involves copying files directly from your development server
onto the CFast flash card. So you need a USB CFast flash card reader.

To install ACL linux after inserting the CFast card into the reader and
connecting that to your local development server do the following.

The following notes assume that the CFast card appeared as device
/dev/sdd, modify accordingly for the device that is used on your system.
It is quite likely that when you insert the CFast card your linux system
will automount the partitions on the CFast card. This is fine, you won't
need to carry out all the mount steps in the following instructions, but
you may need to adjust the copy destinations to match the automounted
mount points.

1. mount /dev/sdd4 /media/Kernel1
2. cp accelerated-linux/images/vmlinuz /media/Kernel1/vmlinuz
   cp accelerated-linux/images/vmlinuz.sig /media/Kernel1/vmlinuz.sig

3. umount /dev/sdd5
   (only required if automounted)
4. dd if=accelerated-linux/images/rootfs of=/dev/sdd5

5. mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt
6. cp accelerated-linux/images/initrd /mnt/initrd
   cp accelerated-linux/images/initrd.sig /mnt/initrd.sig

7. mount /dev/sdd8 /media/UserFS
8. mkdir /media/UserFS/config
   touch /media/UserFS/config/.init

Cleanly unmount any of the CFast mounted filesystems, and re-insert the
card into the TX64.

The TX64 will need to be set to development mode via the DIP switch setting.

Power up the TX64 and it will boot the ACL kernel. Console will be on the
external serial port at 115200,8,n,1. The primary LAN interface is by
default on eth4 port. Default ACL configures a fixed address on that
port of 192.168.210.1. The WEB management interface will be available on
that address from a browser on that network address.
