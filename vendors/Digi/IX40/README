DIGI/IX40

USB LOADING
-----------

On a bare board with no programmed flash you can use the USB debug loading
procedure of the iMX8 SoC to carry out a first boot. You will need to have
the "USB Boot" jumper installed to do this.

Use the Freescale "uuu" tool to do USB loading. You can find the source to
the uuu program in the Freescale iMX mfgtools package. With that built and
installed then run:

    uuu imx-boot-imx8mpevk-sd.bin-flash_evk

Fit link CON14 (USB boot) and CON1 (CPU Boot from USB).
Connect 3 pin USB cable to CON13 (Black-White-Green)
uuu images/boot-usb.bin


NETWORK LINUX LOAD
------------------

Generate images for this board using the Digi/IX40 accelerated linux
target. The default is to select the musl C-library when building.
The build will generate separate kernel, root filesystem and devicetree blobs.

You can load onto the IX40 board using the usual u-boot loader installed
in the boot ROM of the board.

  setenv bootargs console=ttymxc0,115200n8 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x60000000,64M
  dhcp 0x40480000 kernel
  tftpboot 0x4c000000 imx8mp-ix40.dtb
  tftpboot 0x60000000 rootfs.bin
  booti 0x40480000 - 0x4c000000

The serial console is on the usual 4-pin TTL console header. You will need
TTL to RS-232 converter. The console serial port is at the default
115200,8,n,1.

This also works, using the single FIT u-boot image:

  setenv bootargs console=ttymxc0,115200n8 root=/dev/ram0
  dhcp 0x60000000 ix40-initrd.itb
  bootm 0x60000000
