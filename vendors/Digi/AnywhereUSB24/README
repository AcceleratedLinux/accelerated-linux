DIGI ANYWHEREUSB-24
-------------------

This is just some random notes on building and running on the AnywhereUSB-24
platform. This is very much a work in progress.

The Digi/AnywhereUSB-24 board is built around an NXP/Freescale Layerscape
1046 SoC. (This is an ARM64 CPU based device).

Generate images for this board using the Digi/AnywhereUSB24 accelerated
target. The default is to select the glibc when building. The build will
generate a single "itb" u-boot mutli-image format binary,
images/anywhereusb24.itb. A number of the build artifacts, line kernel and
root filesystem, are also present in that images/ directory.

You can load onto the AnywhereUSB-24 board using the usual uboot loader
installed in the boot ROM of the board. (You can break to the uboot serial
port prompt, by hitting a key during the early uboot startup).

    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x21c0500 mtdparts=1550000.spi:1m(rcw),1m(u-boot),1m(env),1m(ucode)
    dhcp 0xa0000000 anywhereusb24-initrd.itb
    bootm 0xa0000000

This assumes you have a local network with addresses setup with DHCP and
tftp server.

The console is the external serial port (at the default 115200,8,n,1).

Legacy loading of the kernel, rootfs and devicetree is possible if you
really need to. The generated binaries images/kernel.bin, images/rootfs.bin
and images/anywhereusb24.dtb can be loaded using u-boot commands:

    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 initrd=0x98000000,24M earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x21c0500 mtdparts=1550000.spi:1m(rcw),1m(u-boot),1m(env),1m(ucode)
    dhcp 0x90000000 kernel.bin
    tftpboot 0x97000000 anywhereusb24.dtb
    tftpboot 0x98000000 rootfs.bin
    booti 0x90000000 - 0x97000000
