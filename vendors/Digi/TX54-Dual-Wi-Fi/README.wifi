CERTIFICATION TESTING
---------------------

For lab certification testing of the Wi-Fi hardware module it may be
necessary to use the Qualcomm/Atheros qca-ilq driver instead of the mainline
ath10k Wi-Fi driver that we use in the shipping product.

To do that you will need to enable a number of extra switches and flags at
configure and compile time.

Specifically in the kernel you need to enable:

    CONFIG_MODULE_TAINT_OVERRIDE

And you will have to disable the ath10k driver in the kernel:

    # CONFIG_WLAN_VENDOR_ATH is not set
    # CONFIG_ATH_COMMON is not set

In the modules configuration you need to enable:

    MODULES_ILQ_WLAN=y

And in the user/vendor configuration you need to enable:

    CONFIG_PROP_QCMBR_QCMBR=y
    CONFIG_PROP_QCA_ILQ=y

That will build firmware capable of using the qca-ilq wlan driver.

For actual testing you need to put the TX54 into emctest enabled mode:

    fw_setenv emctest enabled

And finally the tools need to be launched at boot time so that the
Qualcomm Radio Control Tool (QRCT) program can talk to the WLE600VX module
on the TX54. The simplest method to do that is to modify the factory
test script (vendors/AcceleratedConcepts/romfs/etc/factory) installed on
the TX54 (before building firmware) and adding lines like this at about
line 36:

    if [ "$(fw_printenv emctest)" = "emctest=enabled" ] ; then
           modprobe qca_ol testmode=1
           echo "qcmbr:unknown:/bin/Qcmbr" >> /var/run/inittab
    fi

When the TX54 boots now it will enter emctest mode with the Qcmbr test
daemon running and ready to communicate with the QRCT testing tool over
the LAN ethernet interface.

Note that when using the QRCT tool you need to select the "Chipset" as
"QC9800" and in the "Chip Selection" you need to choose the firmware file
"fakeBoardData_AR6004.bin" (from prop/qca-ilq) as the BDF file.
