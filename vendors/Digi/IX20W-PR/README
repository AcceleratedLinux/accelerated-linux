IX20W
-----

The IX20W has no external USB ports, there is a 3 pin header that may not be
fitted on production PCBA's. CON16

To carry out a USB recovery load you would normally need to jumper the
header that enables USB load. If the nand flash is currently
empty then the Freescale iMX6 CPU will automatically fall back to the USB
recovery load mode (no header jumping required).
Otherwise jump pins 2 & 3 on CON11. (R60 must not be present)

To load a boot loader through the USB you need Freescales "imx_usb" tool
installed on your Linux PC development system.

Power up the IX20W with the USB connected to your Linux PC. Note the USB cable
you need is differnt to the one we use on the 6310-DX and ConnectIT4, rx and tx
have swapped. Check that the USB load device was detected properly:

  lsusb | grep -i freescale

It should report back with something similar to this if found:

  Bus 003 Device 011: ID 15a2:0080 Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.

The USB load process is straight forward from a compiled tree:

  imx_usb -v boot/build/uboot-imx/u-boot.imx

You may need to run it as root.

The normal bootloader is quiet, so you will not see anything on the console
until linux has booted.

You can make the uboot output trace by making the following changes in
/boot/patches/u-boot-freescale-imx6-11-IX20.patch

-+#define CONFIG_ENV_VARS_UBOOT_RUNTIME_CONFIG
++/*#define CONFIG_ENV_VARS_UBOOT_RUNTIME_CONFIG*/

-+#define CONFIG_SILENT_CONSOLE
-+#define CONFIG_SILENT_U_BOOT_ONLY
++/*#define CONFIG_SILENT_CONSOLE*/
++/*#define CONFIG_SILENT_U_BOOT_ONLY*/

Within a few seconds the usual u-boot boot up messages should come out of
the serial console port of the IX20W.

FLASH PROGAMMING u-boot
-----------------------

The process to flash the u-boot loader into flash memory is a little
different than other Accelerated/Digi boards. This is due to the unusual
flash and ECC layout used by Freescale's internal iMX6 CPU boot loader.

The process is now essentially a 2 step process from an IX20W shell login:

  netflash -iknb -R /tmp/u-boot.imx 192.168.0.22 u-boot.imx
  kobs-ng init -v -x /tmp/u-boot.imx

You cannot directly netflash the u-boot binary.

***WARNING***
The production u-boot image has been HAB signed, allowing the secure
boot functionality to be used. If the SRK and secure boot fuses have
been burnt, then only images which have been encrypted using the same
keys as burnt to the fuses will be allowed to run. If an incorrect
u-boot is uploaded, then the unit will be *unrecoverable* via software.
The only way to recover the unit is to desolder the NAND chip and
program it with the correctly signed ECC image.

FACTORY FLASH
-------------

The factory pre-program flash image file is not automatially generated as
part of the firmware compilation. Due to the unusual layout and ECC required
it must be read from flash after installed onto an IX20W. Even worse is that
you cannot read the raw NAND flash contents from Linux itself - you need to
read it from u-boot. You could also read the nand flash in the beeprog reader.
The following process reads the nand from u-boot:

So to generate the factory boot loader file run the following command from
the u-boot command line on an IX20W which has had the boot loader required
already flashed into the boot partition:

  nand read.raw 0x81000000 0 0xa00
  md.b 0x81000000 0x00528000

You will need to capture the serial output on your development server.
It will take quite a few minutes (at least 20+) to dump out the boot loader
flash contents.

On your Linux development server you now need to take that capture serial
console output and turn it into the pre-program binary file. First edit
the captured serial output to remove any lines not part of the hexdump.
Modify the address to start the dump addresses from 0x00000000 (in "vim"
you can use a command like "1,$s/
81/00/g"). The use the xxd tool to
convert it to a binary file.

  xxd -r < console-output > u-boot-with-ecc.bin

Note that you must use a device with a NAND flash that has no Bad Blocks
within the boot loader flash partition (which is the first 5MB of flash).
The factory based programmer will rely on a boot loader image that has a
pristine in-flash boot loader section. Bad Blocks will force a different
layout - and that will break real device booting on any other flash device.

You can check for location of bad blocks during the kernel boot on the
IX20W device. Look for the NAND flash discovery messages during boot and it
will list the Bad Block locations:

  nand: device found, Manufacturer ID: 0x2c, Chip ID: 0xda
  nand: Micron MT29F2G08ABAEAWP
  nand: 256 MiB, SLC, erase size: 128 KiB, page size: 2048, OOB size: 64

CERTIFICATION TESTING
---------------------

For lab certification testing of the Wi-Fi hardware module it may be
necessary to use the Qualcomm/Atheros qcacld driver instead of the mainline
ath10k Wi-Fi driver that we use in the shipping product.

To do that you will need to enable a number of extra switches and flags at
configure and compile time.

Specifically in the kernel you need to enable:

    CONFIG_SUSPEND=y
    CONFIG_SUSPEND_FREEZER=y
    CONFIG_PM_SLEEP=y
    CONFIG_PM=y
    CONFIG_BLK_PM=y
    CONFIG_FREEZER=y
    CONFIG_NL80211_TESTMODE=y
    CONFIG_FW_CACHE=y

In the modules configuration you need to enable:

    CONFIG_QCA_CLD_WLAN=y

And in the user/vendor configuration you need to enable:

    CONFIG_PROP_QCMBR_QCMBR=y
    CONFIG_PROP_QCACLD_FIRMWARE=y

That will build firmware capable of using the qcacld wlan driver.

For actual testing you need to put the IX20 into emctest enabled mode:

    fw_setenv emctest enabled

And finally the tools need to be launched at boot time so that the
Qualcomm Radio Control Tool (QRCT) program can talk to the WSD377 module
on the IX20. The simplest method to do that is to modify the factory
test script (vendors/AcceleratedConcepts/romfs/etc/factory) installed on
the IX20 (before building firmware) and adding lines like this at about
line 36:

    if [ "$(fw_printenv emctest)" = "emctest=enabled" ] ; then
           modprobe wlan con_mode=5
           echo "qcmbr:unknown:/bin/Qcmbr" >> /var/run/inittab
    fi

When the IX20 boots now it will enter emctest mode with the Qcmbr test
daemon running and ready to communicate with the QRCT testing tool over
the WAN ethernet interface.
