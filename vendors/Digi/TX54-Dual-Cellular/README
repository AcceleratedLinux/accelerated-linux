DIGI/TX54-Dual-Cellular
---------

You will need the serial debug console hookup and enabled to see and use
u-boot on this platform. On the TX54-Dual-Cellular this console is at
115200,8n1.


NETWORK LOADING
---------------

You can load an image from TFTP and run it through U-Boot's recovery-mode:

    - Connect the device with your PC through the ETH2 port
    - Copy the image.bin into your TFTP directory
    - Set your PC's IP to 192.168.1.100 (the device will use 192.168.1.1)
    - Power off the board
    - Keep reset button pressed
    - Power on the board
    - After ~5 seconds, all the GREEN LEDs will blink
    - Still keep the button pressed for ~5 seconds, until all LEDs (except the
    power LED) will go off, and only the first ORANGE will light. That means,
    U-Boot is in recovery-mode

The U-Boot will fetch the image from the PC's TFTP, verifies it, and boot it.


FLASH INSTALL
-------------

If you're running an DAL image on the device, you can install a new image
on the flash with the following shell commands:

    netflash -bUk 192.168.1.100 image.bin

That will take care about the dual-boot parameters.

Or if you want to manually update a boot partition:

Update partition 0:

    netflash -kb -r /dev/flash/image 192.168.1.22 image.bin
    fw_setenv part0_valid 1
    fw_setenv boot_part 0

Update partition 1:

    netflash -kb -r /dev/flash/image1 192.168.1.22 image.bin
    fw_setenv part1_valid 1
    fw_setenv boot_part 1
