DIGI TX40
---------

The Digi/TX40 board is using NXP Layerscape LS1027A SoC. (ARMv8 64-bit core.)

It is using multiple boot stages. First it runs the built-in ROM code (BL1),
which loads the RCW (Reset Configuration Word) from the SPI NOR's 0x00000000
address, and does some low-level initialization (clocks, pinmuxes, etc).
The RCW contains a small code inside, which starts BL2 (platform initialization
firmware) (image is merged with the RCW).
On this platform, we are using TF-A (ARM's Trusted Firmware) as BL2. That
initializes e.g. DDR, and loads the merged BL33 (U-Boot) and BL31 (resident
runtime firmware) image from SPI NOR (address 0x00100000) to the DDR, and starts
that. This is called (FIP image).

The build process is of these images:
 - build RCW
 - build U-Boot
 - build BL2 image with TFA (using RCW)
   This generates the 'bl2_flexspi_nor.pbl' image. Write it into the SPI flash,
   address 0x00000000
 - build FIP image with TFA (using U-Boot)
   This generates the 'fip.bin' image. Write it into the SPI flash, address
   0x00100000

See 'cw' folder for XSPI flash configuration for CodeWarrior.

  EVT units
---------------
The TX40 EVT units have slightly different GPIO arrangement, and different chips
are used (accelerometer, GPIO expander).

To build firmware for the EVT units, use:

 # CONFIG_DEFAULTS_DIGI_TX40_EVT=y make Digi/TX40_default

or after:

 # CONFIG_DEFAULTS_DIGI_TX40_EVT=y make

In U-Boot, CONFIG_TARGET_TX40_EVT=y should be enabled.
