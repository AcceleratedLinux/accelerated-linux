Start the Debugger
------------------

From the top of the tree run:

	sudo openocd -f tools/openocd/targets/5400-rm.cfg

You will need and openocd installation (lastest from git is best)
This will load and run u-boot.  Break into u-boot to a prompt and run tyhe
following if you have network support (you can use USB support otherwise,
see later):

	nand erase.chip
    dhcp 0x800000 u-boot.kwb

Check that u-boot.kwb was loaded,  if not (perhaps image.bin was loaded),
run:

	tftpboot 0x800000 u-boot.kwb

once u-boot.kwb has been loaded into RAM you can run:

    nand write 0x800000 0 80000

At this point it is best to power off,  remove the debugger and then repower
and drop into the u-boot prompt.

	saveenv
	run netload

Once booted into linux run:

	/etc/mkffs
	ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1/24
	netflash -kib 192.168.0.2 image.bin
	netflash -kib -r /dev/flash/image1 192.168.0.2 image.bin

The reason we disconnect the debugger is that it often interferes with linux
causing crashes.

Program u-boot -- from network using u-boot
-------------------------------------------

nand erase 0 100000
dhcp 0x800000 u-boot.kwb
nand write 0x800000 0 80000

Program u-boot -- from usb using u-boot
---------------------------------------

nand erase 0 100000
fatload usb 0 0x800000 u-boot.kwb
nand write 0x800000 0 80000

Load a new boot loader from linux
---------------------------------

netflash -n -i -k -b -r /dev/flash/boot 192.168.0.2 u-boot.kwb
