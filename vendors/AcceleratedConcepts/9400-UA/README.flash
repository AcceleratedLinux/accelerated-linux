9400-UA FLASH
-------------

We can program the BIOS flash of the 9400-UA in-circuit using a specially
modified SG580 SPI programmer(*).

To program the flash connect the SG580 SPI programmer header to the 4-pin
flash programming header (CON5) on the 9400-UA. Be sure to get pin 1 (with
the dot) lined up and at the right end.

Power up both boards. The SG580 will do a typical boot and you end up at
a shell prompt. You can dump the current contents of the flash using a
command like:

  dd if=/dev/spi of=/tmp/boot.bin

Of course you can visually inspect it on the console too:

  hd -b /dev/spi | more

To program the flash firstly copy the binary file you want to load into
the flash onto the SG580 SPI prgrammer. Typically something like:

  scp 192.168.0.22:coreboot.rom /tmp/

Then to program that into the flash do:

  dd if=/tmp/coreboot.rom of=/dev/spi bs=4194304

It will give some nice console trace to let you know how it is progressing.
It generally takes a minute or 2 to program a 4Mb flash. Note that the
program step needs to supply the image as a single write() - so that is
why the "bs" is set to the full 4Mb (4194304) image size.



(*) The SG580 SPI programmer is a modified SG580 unit that has the SPI
    signals derived from LED lines. It runs modified firmware that is the
    base SG580 with the "snapspi" driver enabled. That driver is in our
    linux tree as drivers/char/snapspi.c.
