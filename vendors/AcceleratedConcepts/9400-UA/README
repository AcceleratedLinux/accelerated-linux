9400-UA
-------

The 9400-UA platform is based on an AMD GX-420 quadcore x86 CPU. We run
it in x86_64 64bit mode as standard.

It is largely a standard PC type platform. As such we can run our images
on standard PC hardware, and even on KVM/QEMU emulators. Here is a simple
example of how to run it under QEMU on a desktop Linux system:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -smp cpus=4 -cdrom images/9400-UA.iso -serial stdio

This boots up our USB based install/setup image. It may be a little confusing
that the vga console starts up with the isolinux boot prompt. But then on
Linux kernel boot the starting shell takes over as the machine console.
This is because we normally run our system with serial port console - not
the start up vga console. (On real 9400-UA hardware all output is via the
serial port - even the ISO boot step).


Virtual 9400-UA Setup for use with Aview
----------------------------------------

The following example assume linux and "qemu" or kvm.  You could just as
easily setup the VM under Virtualbox or some other system.  Just ensure that
the 4th network interface provides us with a DHCP address and preferrable
internet.  Obviously you can configure and of the 5 network interfaces to
provide the needed connectivity but for simplicity,  just go with the 4th
interface for now :-)

1. Create a HDD image as big as you would like. 20G should run a good lots
   of stuff.  You can go leaner or bigger,  if you go leaner its your
   responsibility to understand how that limits you.
   
   IMAGE_FILE=9400-hdd.img
   qemu-img create $IMAGE_FILE 20G

2. Boot the ISO (wait for the ISO boot timeout before getting output):

   IMAGE_FILE=9400-hdd.img; sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp cpus=4 -net nic,vlan=1 -net nic,vlan=2 -net nic,vlan=3 -net nic,vlan=4 -net nic,vlan=5 -net user,vlan=4 -nographic -cdrom images/9400-UA.iso -drive file=$IMAGE_FILE,if=none,id=hdimage -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci -device ide-drive,drive=hdimage,bus=ahci.0 -boot d 

3. Get a shell

   login as root/default and run:
      config set auth user root password default
      config set auth group admin acl shell enable true
   logout and back in using 'Shell' this time.

4. Make the filesystems (reduced sizing).  Get a real MAC/Serial from davidm
   if you want to use with Aview.

   /etc/mkffs 1000
   echo "/opt/bootenv.img 0 0x80000" > /etc/fw_env.config
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/opt/bootenv.img bs=524288 count=1
   fw_setenv ethaddr  00:27:04:........
   fw_setenv eth1addr 00:27:04:........
   fw_setenv eth2addr 00:27:04:........
   fw_setenv eth3addr 00:27:04:........
   fw_setenv eth4addr 00:27:04:........
   fw_setenv serial 940001..........

5. Program in the image (takes a while ever, slow emulated disk performance)
   You can use a relase 9400-UA-*-image.bin off jenkins instead of image.bin.

   netflash -ki dev-box-ip image.bin

6, Run the fully functional HDD version

   IMAGE_FILE=9400-hdd.img; sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp cpus=4 -net nic,vlan=1 -net nic,vlan=2 -net nic,vlan=3 -net nic,vlan=4 -net nic,vlan=5 -net user,vlan=4,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::4443-:443 -nographic -drive file=$IMAGE_FILE,if=none,id=hdimage -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci -device ide-drive,drive=hdimage,bus=ahci.0

7. Add your VM to Aview,  access the web pages at https://localhost:4443/ or
   ssh into it with 'ssh -p 2222 root@localhost'.

   To point a unit at "theme",  currently required for uCPE:

   config set config.certificate_url https://theme.accns.com/certificates/v2
   config set config.config_url.0 https://theme.accns.com/
