DialCaptureDevice JTAG
----------------------

The openocd jtag package can be used with the iMX253 based 5301-DC boards.
It can quite easily be used to load boot code (like u-boot) and then from
there you can program the SPI flash.

As of this writing I am using openocd-0.6.1. Later versions should work ok.
I am using an Amontec JTAGkey USB based jtag debug dongle. I expect most
other standard types of USB jtah dongle would work.

With the JTAG adapter conected to the 5301-DC board run openocd with:

    sudo openocd -f tools/openocd/targets/5300-dc.cfg

Then on another console telnet to the openocd daemon:

    telnet localhost 4444

Then issue the following commands:

    reset halt
    boot-load
    resume

This will load up and run u-boot (compiled in your uclinux-dist source
tree). From here you can load and run linux and work within u-boot.

    netflash -kibn -r /dev/flash/boot W.X.Y.Z boot.bin
    netflash -kib 192.168.0.2 image.bin
    netflash -kib -r /dev/flash/image1 W.X.Y.Z image.bin
