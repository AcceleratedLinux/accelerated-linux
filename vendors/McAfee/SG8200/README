SNAPGEAR CAVIUM OCTEON FLASH
----------------------------

1. LOADING BOOT LOADER

   Use MentorGraphics Majic-LT debugger and their EPItools software
   package. It is a set of 32bit x86 binaries, but I have been running
   it on a x86_64 box with no problems at all. (I have been using version
   2.4c).

   At the root of a built tree run:

       monice.static -d 10.46.12.10:e -7 -vcnmips

   Substitue an appropriate IP address that you have the Majic-LT box
   setup for. Or you can use it through the serial port instead of over
   ethernet.

   Then run the following commands:

      fr m boot/boot.bin 0x100000:p
      l tools/misc/mips/flasher.128k.500mhz
      ed pc = 0
      g

   That will print out progress trace on the serial port of the SnapGear
   device being programmed.
