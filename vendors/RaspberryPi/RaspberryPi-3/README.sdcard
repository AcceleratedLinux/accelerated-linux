To create the initial sdcard image after a successfull build run the following:
./mk_firmware_image.sh ../../../images/sdcard.img sdcard 3
To flash the image to an sd card:
sudo dd if=../../../images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
NOTE: replace /dev/sdX with your sdcard device!
to resize the /opt to use rest of sdcard
sudo parted /dev/sdX resizepart 4 100%

#Contents of 1st partition should look like this:
bcm*.dtb bootcode.bin boot.scr norm.scr config.txt start.elf u-boot.bin zImageA zImageB

# If you want to use wifi you will need to download the firmware & put it in /opt
/opt/rtl8188eufw.bin

# /opt/custom.sh is run at start if it exists.
# /opt/76-custom.rules is udev rules, add your devices to assign them accordingly.
