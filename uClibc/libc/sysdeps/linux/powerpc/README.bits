include/bits is mostly the same as glibc-2.2.4.  The glibc-2.2.4
versions can be accessed with the tag glibc224.

Major differences:

  - termios.h is from the Linux kernel, not glibc, because glibc has
    a very strange legacy conversion layer, which we ignore.

  - syscall.h is deleted; instead, sysnum.h is autogenerated in uClibc

  - syscalls.h is added.
