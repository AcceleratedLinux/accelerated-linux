Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the README file for the i960 support in uClibc.

This has been tested with gcc 2.95.3 and i960-intel-coff target.

There is no support at all to compile with the intel CTOOLS, as this would
have required too many changes to uClibc.  So you won't see any support 
in the asm files for position independent data or code.

Quirks needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

prepended underscore
--------------------

As the i960 compiler prepends an underscore to symbols, it is critical that
Rules.mak defines SYMBOL_PREFIX as _, such that -D__UCLIBC_UNDERSCORES__
is added to CFLAGS to make sure that underscores are applied to symbol
names when needed.


__va_copy in va-i960.h
----------------------

When compiled with gcc-2.95, the __va_copy macro in va-i960.h seems to be broken
and it has to be modified in order for uClibc to compile correctly.

Change:

#define __va_copy(dest, src) (dest) = (src)

To:

#define __va_copy(dest, src)  dest[0] = src[0]; dest[1] = src[1]


gcc integration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've preferred modifying the specs file so that the i960-intel-coff compiler
directly compiles with uClibc.

First, compile and install the standard i960-intel-coff compiler, which is meant
to be used with newlib.

Then, compile uClibc, installing over the newlib include files and libraries.

Update the specs file with the included specs.uclinux.gcc-2.95.i960-intel-coff

This specs file always build relocatable objects, which has the disadvantage
of not letting you know if the link is missing any symbols.

coff2flt
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the executables under uClinux, fully relocatable binaries 
need to be built using coff2flt.

We have built a working coff2flt that works with the i960 and the current version
of binfmt_flat with uClinux.
