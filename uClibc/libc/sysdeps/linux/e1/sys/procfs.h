/* This is somewhat modelled after the file of the same name on SVR4
   systems.  It provides a definition of the core file format for ELF
   used on Linux.  It doesn't have anything to do with the /proc file
   system, even though Linux has one.

   Anyway, the whole purpose of this file is for GDB and GDB only.
   Don't read too much into it.  Don't use it for anything other than
   GDB unless you know what you are doing.  */
