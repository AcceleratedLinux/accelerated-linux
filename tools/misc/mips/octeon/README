FLASH PROGRAMMING THE SNAGEAR OCTEON BOARDS THROUGH JTAG
--------------------------------------------------------

The following sequence is what I use on the Mentor Graphics MAJIC-LT JTAG
debugger for programming the flash on the SnapGear Octeon based boards.

    fr m boot.bin 0x100000:p
    l flasher.128k.700mhz
    ed pc = 0
    g

boot.bin is the boot loader that you want to load.
flasher.128k.700mhz is the flasher program binary. I have created varients
for the slightly differently setup boards. 500mhz and 700mhz varients for
different speed clock CPU's. 128k is the size that gets programmed, for
SnapGear boot loaders 128k is what we would typically use.
