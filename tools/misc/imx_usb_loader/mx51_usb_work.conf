#jump nnn - new header is placed after last downloaded word
#            entire file is loaded before jump, needs load nnn as well
# i.e. file:load nnn,jump nnn
#jump header - only length parameter is downloaded
#     header - uses existing header(error if none), but clears plug and dcd values unless plug also specified
#     header2 - uses 2nd header found(error if none)
#plug - without jump uses header but clears plug flag to stop after plug execution
