Running DAL devtests

This is intended for use by engineers and developers making code changes to DAL features.
Making sure that these changes do not break existing functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workflow

From root directory.
'make dal_devtests'
This will create images/dal_devtests.tgz
Copy this file to DAL device either /tmp or /opt and extract.
login to device and change to dal_devtests directory.

'./run_tests.sh'
This will run all tests

or if you are just checking for example surelink you can run just those tests
'./surelink/test_surelink.sh'

or if you want to just run the surelink tests for say modem interface only.
'./surelink/test_surelink.sh test_surelink_modem'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investigating an issue

You can also for example just apply the config for a particular test so you can keep it in that state until you are finished.

'./surelink/test_surelink.sh test_surelink_modem config'
It should apply the config etc and exist so you can have a look around.
When you are finished to restore as it would do after the test had finished.
'./surelink/test_surelink.sh test_surelink_modem restore'
