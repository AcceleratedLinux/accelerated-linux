COMPILER TOOLS
--------------

No compiler tools are provided in this source distribution.
Generally any cross tool chain can be used for building.

Note that for quite a few non-MMU targets you may need a toolchain
that can generate flat format binaries. You may find usefull binary
toolchains on www.uclinux.org.

CodeSourcery toolchains have been used, as have the cross-tool chain
packages of common distributions such as Ubuntu.

You can of course build your own too. The usual set of GNU tools
should be enough. Typically you will want to build:

    binutils
    gcc
 
You will usually need to build with a libc as well (such as glibc or
uClibc).
